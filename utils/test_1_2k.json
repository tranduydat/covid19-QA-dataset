        "answer": "Yes they can. The viruses that cause a cold include rhinoviruses (up to 80%), coronaviruses and influenza (together accounting for much of the remaining 20%) and a small percentage of adenoviruses. When discussing cross species transfer, influenza is the most important to discuss as it is a fairly common cause of the \"common cold\". \n\nInfluenza A has humans, pigs, bird and horses as its host. Different influenza strains have different hosts. Influenza can recombine if two strains infect the same host (antigenic shift) and also mutate (antigenic drift). With a combination of these influenza can and has numerous times crossed the species barrier which has caused the major flu pandemics as well as swine and avian flu. It's this reservoir that makes these viruses so hard to eradicate. When we are the only host such as in polio virus, it is a lot easier. Pigs don't adhere to national flu guidelines. \n\nComparing recovery times, all mammals are roughly similar although due to our slightly more evolved immune system as well as social factors of knowing what to do when we are ill we recovery very slightly earlier.\n"

        "question": "It's my understanding that the majority of symptoms associated with the common cold (runny nose, inflamed sinus, slight fever) are essentially the result of the immune system's response.\n\nI've never heard of someone dying of the common cold (unlike influenza), even in immune compromised people. As such, what damage would the cold virus inflict if there was no immune response? Would it be catastrophic?\n",
        "answer": "Can someone die of the common cold?\n\nNo. \nThe common cold is a clinical syndrome restricted to upper respiratory tract involvement. By clinical syndrome, I mean it is the constellation of symptoms (rather than the consequence of a specific pathogen). As you mention, these symptoms are the result of the immune response, rather than tissue damage or compromised function as a direct effect of a pathogen or its toxin (e.g., the watery diarrhea in cholera).  \n\nAs defined (see, e.g., Cecil Medicine Ch. 369), this clinical syndrome cannot lead to death. \n\n\n  The common cold is an upper respiratory syndrome of rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction, frequently accompanied by sore throat, sneezing, and cough.\n\n\nCan the viruses that cause the common cold cause death?\n\nYes. Many viruses that cause the common cold also cause other clinical syndromes that can cause death. This occurs when viral replication moves to the lower respiratory tract. As an example, influenza viruses are responsible for 25 - 30% of common colds (see Bennett, Principles and Practice of Infectious Disease, Ch.58). When it moves beyond the upper respiratory tract, influenza is responsible for substantial mortality. Other virus families that are responsible for both a common cold syndrome and lower respiratory tract syndrome in immunocompetent individuals (e.g., bronchiolitis, pneumonia) include parainfluenza virus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and (rarely) coronavirus. Rhinovirus, responsible for 40-50% of common cold cases, is uniquely unsuited to lower respiratory tract involvement, because of its preference for the cooler environment of the nasal mucosa, replicating best at 33 C (Murray Medical Microbiology, Ch 56). However, in individuals with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), lower respiratory tract involvement does occur. There are a number of case series reporting death due to lower respiratory rhinovirus. This is an example.\n\nCan the common cold lead to serious illnesses other than lower respiratory tract involvement?\n\nYes. Other morbidity can occur as a result of the immune response that produces the common cold syndrome. Rhinorrhea and congestion can progress to a viral rhinosinusitis, a separate syndrome with its own complications, or a secondary bacterial infection, which can lead to bacterial sinus involvement and/or bacterial lower respiratory tract infection. Otitis media is another common complication, especially in children, and has its own potential complications. Asthma (and, generally speaking, most lung diseases) can also be exacerbated by what would otherwise be a simple common cold and predisposes to lower respiratory tract involvement. Asthma does deserve special mention, because rhinovirus associated exacerbations can be fatal, but this is a consequence of asthma rather than a common cold syndrome. Further discussion of these syndromes are beyond the scope of the question, but are discussed briefly in the chapters referenced above.\n"

        "question": "We would buy a mobile air purifier in our home. \n\nAgainst the smoke of the city, etc. \n\nIt would have a HEPA + activated carbon filter. They are marketing it as: \n\n\n  \"filtration process captures 99.97% of airborne particles down to 0.1\n  micron in size.\"\n\n\nand having also: \n\n\n  \"encapsulated ion particle charging chamber\"\n\n\nBut the question: \n\nWould the mentioned filter+ion charger also help cleaning the air from bacteria and viruses? \n\nEx.: \"Coronavirus/2019-nCoV\" is about \"Coronavirus virions are spherical with diameters of approximately 125 nm\" - but I just Googled it, not from an official source. And 0.1 micron is 100 nm. \n\nUPDATE: would it be more effective, if it would have UV-C light in the air purifier? \n",
        "answer": "The aforementioned filter will filter microbes\n\nYes, it is routine practice to use microfiltration in labs to sterilize solutions from microbes. 0.2 micron filters will remove all typically-found bacteria most of the time, except for the odd bacteria here and there, though this is uncommon. 0.1 micron filters certainly remove all stray bacteria that may make it through upon a single 0.2 micrometer filtration. Here is a nice read on the appropriateness of 0.2 and 0.1 microfilters, which simply states that 0.2 micro filters are usually more appropriate since they additionally guarantee a better flow rate.\n\nThe aforementioned filter will NOT ensure filtration of viruses\n\nThese filters are not used, suitable nor effective for viruses, however. You ask specifically about the coronavirus. From a 2015 study:\n\n\n  Coronaviruses are members of the Coronaviridae group and contain a\n  single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome surrounded by a corona-like\n  helical envelope (Ryan 1994). The SARS virus genome consists of 29,751\n  base pairs. Approximately 41% of the genome is GC base pairs while 59%\n  is TA base pairs. Coronaviruses have a size range of 0.08-0.15\n  microns; with a mean size of 0.11 microns (see Figure 1).\n\n\nThis means 0.1 micron filters will not protect you from these viruses. They may help you reduce viral count in the air, which may of course be sufficient, but this would not be an adequate measure in a biological safety facility.\n\nThe cost-effectiveness of commercial air-purifiers for biosafety vs. pollution\n\nOn a advice-related note: I do not think air-purifiers are going to help you in a cost-effective manner to avoid viruses (e.g. Rhinoviruses that cause the common cold, for instance), lest you stay at home all the time. You expose yourself outdoors, and carry plenty of viruses indoors on your body and in your respiratory tract; these will bypass your filtration system on the daily. Being healthy and lucky enough to avoid exposure to viruses outside the house is still the best bet. I think an air purifier has a greater potential to help with smog and urban pollution, those particles are typically larger than the diameter of most microbes.\n"

        "question": "Why do coronaviruses come from bats?\n\nI mean, why precisely coronaviruses and not (for instance) herpesviruses?\nIt looks like bats host more zoonotic viruses (per species) than rodents, although they don't develop any sign of disease.\n\nThe article above says that rodents host more zoonotic viruses than bats overall (68 against 61), but at the same time most of the latest pandemics originated from bats.\n\nIt also seems that bats could be involved in the maintenance of ebola viruses.\n\nMy question is: why did these major pandemics originate from bats and not from rodents, although rodents host more zoonotic viruses overall?\n\nWe should also take into consideration that human-rodent interaction is usually more likely than human-bat interaction, except for people who consume bats (like Chinese people; this would (partially) explain why both SARS and 2019-nCoV developed in China).\n",
        "answer": "\n  The preponderance of links between bat and human pathogens has led to a debate about whether bats disproportionately contribute to emerging viral infections crossing the species barrier into humans (26–30). Given the diversity of the Chiroptera order (Figure ​(Figure1),1), we may simply see more bat viruses because there are so many (>1,300) species of bats (31). However, even when accounting for the fact that they make up ~20% of extant terrestrial mammals, bats are overrepresented as reservoir hosts of pathogens with a high potential for spilling into human populations (32, 33). In fact, no known predictors that have been described to impact the likelihood of crossing the species barrier, including reservoir host ecology, phylogenetic relatedness to humans or frequency of reservoir-human contact, explain this pattern (32). Thus, why bats are such a frequent source of pathogenic human viruses remains a tantalizing mystery.\n\n\n--Going to Bat(s) for Studies of Disease Tolerance\n\nOther references that debate whether bats are special, generally conclude that they might somehow be, and argue about causes, include\n\n\nBrook CE, Dobson AP.

        "question": "How do bats survive their own coronaviruses (without showing any symptoms)?\n\nOr, more generically, how can viruses keep reproducing inside healthy carriers without inducing any pathogenic effect?\n\nAre coronaviruses able to replicate themselves without harming bats, or maybe these viruses are just latent like herpesviruses in humans?\n\n\n\nRelated question: Why are bats the source of dangerous coronavirus pandemics?\n",
        "answer": "It's common for the reservoir host of a zoonotic virus to be tolerant of it. MERS coronavirus appears to cause mild or no disease in dromedary camels ( source ), but kills about 35% of confirmed infected humans. ( CDC ) Sin Nombre hantavirus seems to be mild in the deer mice that spread it, despite ~36% fatality rate in humans. ( source ) Mosquitoes are efficient vectors for flaviviruses like dengue and zika in part because they have adaptations we lack that protect them from the virus. ( source ) Also, human communities are host to several viruses: about 90% of people have a herpesvirus infection ( source ) with similar numbers for polyomaviruses. ( source ) Very few of these infected individuals show symptoms.\nThe wide prevalence of these asymptomatic infections shows that the virus is successful when it can replicate while the host remains healthy. In general, virus reproduction kills cells, and when cells die faster than the host can replace them, this causes symptoms up to and including death. The host's immune system supresses virus activity, and a virus that can't evolve ways to avoid immune supression will be wiped out. But if the virus gets so good at avoiding the immune system, it will kill the host, which is bad for the virus. So both host and virus tend to evolve to a point where the immune system wins most, but not all of the time. There is a lot more to it, but I'll stop here.\n\nIn conclusion, we don't really need to look for special properties of bats to explain their tolerance of coronaviruses, even though, as iayork points out, there are reasons to expect bats might be more resistant.\n"

        "question": "Can coronaviruses mutate to an extent to get as dangerous as fliovirusues such as Marburg viruses, Ravn or Ebola Zaire? \n",
        "answer": "'Dangerous' is quite a subjective term, and can be defined in different ways.\n\nViruses vary in their pathogenicity, which is essentially the ability of the virus to cause a disease in a single individual. This can influence other factors, such as the case fatality rate, which is the proportion of people who die from the disease once they have contracted it. For example, the Ebola virus has a very high case fatality rate of up to 90%.\n\nHowever, those aren't the only ways in which you could define 'dangerous'. We might also consider the total number of people that the virus can kill. This often isn't a linear relationship with the case fatality rate. Often, viruses with a high case fatality rate 'burn out' before than can inflict a global pandemic, because people die before they can spread the disease on to others. Vice versa, viruses with a relatively low case fatality rate, such as the Spanish Flu (2-3%) can be extremely 'dangerous' and kill millions of people. \n\nBut there is no hard and fast rule, as the propensity of a virus to cause a global pandemic is influenced by many, many other factors. \n\nSo to answer your question: is it possible for the Covid-19 to mutate into something as dangerous as Ebola? Well, if we are thinking about it's pathogenicity - Influenza A H5N1 (bird flu) had a case fatality rate of about 60%, which is pretty high for a flu virus. For context, the seasonal flu which has a case fatality rate of about 0.1%. I'm not an expert in Virology, so it would be great if someone with more knowledge could confirm this, but it seems very unlikely that the Covid-19 virus could acquire mutations to the degree where it would kill as high as 90% of the people who acquire it, like Ebola does. Ebola is a hemorrhagic virus, which is a totally different mechanism of pathogenicity to the Coronavirus family.  \n\nIt's plausible that Covid-19 could obtain mutations which allow it to transfer more quickly between humans. For example, we know that the Spanish Flu acquired mutations in hemagglutinin subtype which allowed it to be more transmissible between humans. Generally, Coronaviruses have relatively lower R0 rates than other disease (~2/3 compared to Measles which is 12-18). The total number of people killed by the Ebola outbreak was about 11,000. Covid-19 has already killed ~3000 (although the exact figure is hard to quantify), so it seems like on the global level, Covid-19 will be more dangerous than Ebola, if we consider the total number of people killed. \n"

        "answer": "The identification is done by sequencing virus samples and comparing them to reference genomes of viruses. By doing this, you can analyze how closely related an unknown virus is to the references. \n\nFor the nCoV this method shows it is 96% identical with a known bat coronavirus (see reference 1 for details). \nAs viruses accumulate mutations due to errors during replication, this method is also used to generate genetic trees of the virus to analyze how it spreads, map routes of infection and also if the virus has been introduced to humans more than once (reference 2 has a nice overview on this topic).\n\nThe problem here is: You need to have some known references for comparision, if you have a completely new virus which has never emerged before, this will not help. For this reason there are projects ongoing which collect samples to identify yet unknown viruses (see reference 3)\n\n\nDiscovery of a novel coronavirus associated with the recent\npneumonia outbreak in humans and its potential bat origin\nDNA sleuths read the coronavirus genome, tracing its origins and\nlooking for dangerous mutations\nVirome analysis for identification of novel mammalian viruses in\nbats from Southeast China\n\n"

        "question": "Sorry for my lack of understanding, Why now, when people been eating bats for centuries? If bats are simply a vector, where does that virus come from?\n",
        "answer": "Bats are reservoirs of many important human pathogens, some are emerging infections (e.g., 2019-NCoV, the coronavirus in the news recently), and some are not (e.g., rabies). \n\nContact between humans and bats is certainly not a new phenomena, but there is more required for an emerging infection than a reservoir and a new host. There must be some bridge that allows a virus to cross a previously effective species barrier. For SARS, there was an intervening amplifying host, the palm civet.  We've now had long enough to study the molecular biology, so this is now quite well described:\n\n\n  Once SARS-CoV had jumped from bats to civets, it underwent further mutations in civets. The first K479N mutation allowed SARS-CoV to jump from civets to humans and the second S487T mutation allowed SARS-CoV to transmit from human to human, leading to the severe SARS outbreak in 2002–2003.\n\n\nIt may be useful to understand that, as they are RNA viruses, coronaviridae have a high error rate, increasing the rate of mutation. Additionally, making a species jump may allow for novel recombination.\n"

        "answer": "I can't give an authoritative answer on this because my PhD work was based on mRNA delivery using peptides instead of lipids, but many of the concepts are the same. I also don't have time to provide proper citations, but this is probably too much for a comment.\n\nAnyway, mRNA is a very fragile molecule, it can be broken down extremely quickly in the blood by serum nucleases. Therefore we must protect the mRNA by mixing it with some other chemical, in this case a mixture of positively charged lipids. The positively charged lipids are attracted to the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the mRNA, and form a nanoparticle trapping the mRNA inside and hiding it from the nucleases. The lipids are often, but not always, PEGylated, which means that a molecule of polyethylene glycol (PEG) is attached to the lipid. The PEG groups form a layer on the outer surface of the nanoparticle that helps prevent protein binding.\n\nThese mRNA lipid nanoparticles are then injected into a patient. This will probably be an intramuscular injection so that the particles are most likely to be taken up by muscle cells. The exact mechanism explaining why lipid nanoparticles are attracted to cells isn't entirely clear, but it's likely a combination of electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nanoparticle and the negatively charged cell membrane and proteins that bind to the nanoparticle and are then recognized by receptors on the cell surface.\n\nAfter the particle is taken up by a cell it is usually trapped inside a membrane-bound structure called an endosome. As the endosome matures it is acidified, and as the pH drops from about 7 to about 5.5 the nanoparticle is disrupted. The lipids that made up the nanoparticle can merge with the lipids that make up the endosomal membrane, disrupting that membrane and breaking open the endosome, allowing the mRNA to escape into the cytoplasm.\n\nOnce in the cytoplasm the mRNA will find a ribosome and produce protein. Just like you said, the protein in this case will be membrane bound and expressed on the outer surface of the cells for eventual immune recognition.\n"

        "question": "(Not sure if this is the right SE for this question. I'm asking this here, because I'm looking for a biological answer, if one exists.)\n\nThis (potentially very naive) question is inspired by this news article: Bats for sale at Indonesia's wildlife market despite virus warning\n\n\n  Bats, rats and snakes are still being sold at an Indonesian market known for its wildlife offerings, despite a government request to take them off the menu over fears of a link to the deadly coronavirus.\n\n\nWhy would the government request to take the meat of these animals off the market? Even if they're linked to the coronavirus, the virus presumably can be killed by cooking the meat prior to consumption. After all, protein denatures well before 100 degrees celsius, and once it denatures the organism should die. Conceivably the virus could affect the handlers of these animals prior to their being cooked, but not the consumers.\n\nSome paragraphs later in the article illustrate my confusion:\n\n\n  Restaurateur Lince Rengkuan -- who serves bats including their heads and wings stewed in coconut milk and spices -- says the secret is preparation.\n  \n  \"If you don't cook the bat well then of course it can be dangerous,\" she said.\n  \n  \"We cook it thoroughly and so far the number of customers hasn't gone down at all.\"\n\n\nWhich is effectively what I've been thinking, but:\n\n\n  \"We're also urging people not to consume meat from animals suspected to be carriers of a fatal disease,\" said Ruddy Lengkong, head of the area's government trade and industry agency.\n\n\nHow are these two seemingly-contradictory positions reconciled?\n",

        "answer": "This is basic epidemiology. When medical professionals notice that a group of people with some characteristic in common, are being seen for a similar disease, they ask if there's a connection. In this case, several people in Wuhan were diagnosed with severe pneumonia, and the doctors noticed that they worked in the same location. \n\n\n  Three adult patients presented with severe pneumonia and were admitted to a hospital in Wuhan on December 27, 2019. ... Her occupation was retailer in the seafood wholesale market. ... He had been a frequent visitor to the seafood wholesale market.\n\n\n--A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China, 2019\n\nYou're more likely to follow up when the disease is unusual or severe, and when the connecting factor is unusual or suspicious. In this case, the severe pneumonia was presumably unexpected, and live animal markets always have potential for disease transmission. \n\n(In fact, it's quite possible that the virus had been circulating in the region for weeks before this cluster was noticed, and that previous cases had not been surprising enough to trigger the research needed to identify a new virus; though it's also likely that the medical personnel in Wuhan had noticed that there were an usually high number of pneumonia cases and were already looking for a connection.)\n\nSee also the answers to How did scientists discover HIV?. Old-fashioned epidemiology is always critical.\n\nThe same article explains how the virus was sequenced:\n\n\n  Bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid samples were collected in sterile cups to which virus transport medium was added. ... RNA extracted from bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid and culture supernatants was used as a template to clone and sequence the genome. We used a combination of Illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing to characterize the virus genome. \n\n\nAnd isolated:\n\n\n  ... supernatant from bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid samples was inoculated onto the apical surface of the cell cultures. ...  After three passages, apical samples and human airway epithelial cells were prepared for transmission electron microscopy. ... \n\n\nSo briefly, they took patient samples, grew them on cultured cells, used electron microscopy to check the kind of virus. They sequenced fluid (not cells, since the virus would be secreted into the fluid, making it a relatively pure source of virus RNA) and then sequenced using a standard high-throughput sequencing approach; knowing the likely kind of virus would make this easier but isn't essential. There would have been lots of human RNA in the sequence, but it's easy to bioinformatically separate that out and limit your analysis to the viral sequences. The virus isolate was also not essential for the identification; knowing the sequence is the critical information today. But having a virus isolate certainly makes all the subsequent work much easier.\n\nThis is pretty standard modern molecular biology, not an esoteric skill.\n"

        "question": "From a TV news report of a press conference from (I think) the German Robert Koch Institute, I remember hearing an expert declare that he was expecting COVID-19 to get less deadly over time.  Unfortunately, I don't know what press conference it was (I'm not sure if it was the Robert Koch Institute — it might also have been the Charité university hospital) and cannot find such a stated expectation on the internet.\n\nWhy would an expert express this expectation?\n\nIs it because we're heading toward summer (at least where most COVID-19 cases have been reported), or is it a standard pattern, perhaps either due to people's immune systems or due to the virus evolving and becoming weaker? \n",
        "answer": "While the data are much too sparse and noisy to give an answer about what is happening to COVID-19's virulence (the technical term for the \"deadliness\" of an infectious disease), or to forecast what will happen to its virulence in the future, there are indeed theoretical reasons that one might expect the virulence to decline in the future.\n\nThere is an entire theoretical literature on the evolution of virulence (e.g. see Read 1994, or see Wikipedia); Robert May and Paul Ewald are two researchers who contributed seminal ideas. The basic idea is that infectious 'organisms' (including viruses) may face a tradeoff between their ability to produce lots of infectious particles (e.g. by replicating faster within the host) and the length of time that they can stay in the host before it dies or activates immune defenses sufficiently to end the infection. In this case, some intermediate level of virulence may evolve.\n\nEvolution of virulence in ways predicted by the theory has been observed in the real world in such diseases as myxomatosis (a viral disease of rabbits). The theory has also been suggested to apply in HIV and syphilis.\n\nThe actual forecast can depend on many details of the biology and epidemiology of a particular organism. If COVID-19 happened to have a higher-than-optimal virulence in humans at the time of emergence, we could expect its virulence to decline over time. It could also decline if epidemic control was applied in such as way as to differentially affect more-virulent strains; this has been suggested by Tang et al. on the basis of the pattern of mutations in different strains, although their logic has also been criticized on Twitter by an expert in genetic epidemiology, and now by a more official rebuttal by McLean et al. (with some back-and-forth discussion between the authors and critics).\n\nThis explanation doesn't include the possibility of host evolution, which is theoretically important but not really relevant to COVID-19 &mdash; it would only happen over many generations, and only if the epidemic was so severe that it was a significant overall cause of death or failure to reproduce ...\n\n\n\n\nTang et al. \"On the origin and continuing evolution of SARS-CoV-2\", National Science Review, nwaa036, https://doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwaa036 .\nRead, Andrew F. \"The evolution of virulence.\" Trends in microbiology 2.3 (1994): 73-76.\n\n"

        "question": "According to \n\nCoronavirus has mutated at least once\n\n\n  The novel coronavirus that has infected thousands of people across the\n  world may have mutated at least once — meaning there may be two\n  different types of the virus causing illnesses, a new study conducted\n  by Chinese scientists suggests.\n  \n  Scientists with Peking University’s School of Life Sciences and the\n  Institut Pasteur of Shanghai in a preliminary study found that one\n  strain — type “L” —  of the virus was more aggressive and accounted\n  for about 70 percent of the strains analyzed. The second — type “S” —\n  was less aggressive and accounted for about 30 percent of analyzed\n  strains.\n\n\nBut also several webpages theorized the virus has mutated before passing from animals to humans. \n\nThis page What we know about the Wuhan virus says\n\n\n  This virus belongs to a family of viruses known as coronaviruses.\n  Named for the crown-like spikes on their surfaces, they infect mostly\n  bats, pigs and small mammals. But they mutate easily and can jump from\n  animals to humans\n\n\nand\n\n\n  Where did the new coronavirus come from? The new virus likely came\n  originally from bats, scientists say. It isn’t known exactly where or\n  how it jumped to humans, though. Viruses from bats often infect\n  another mammal first and then mutate to become more transmissible to\n  humans.\n\n\nthough\n\n\n  Coronaviruses can also jump directly to humans, without mutating or\n  passing through an intermediate species.\n\n\nIs something more known about this? Is it possible the virus has mutated twice in a period of time of months?\n",
        "answer": "This question makes a number of incorrect assumptions and I don't have time to correct them. The short answer is that the virus has mutated probably hundreds of times since it entered humans in late 2019. \n\nThe lower figure on the NextStrain.org ncov page, \"Diversity\", shows the known mutations that have been identified so far. As I look at it now, there are maybe 100-200 shown there, but that will change daily and I can't be bothered to count them.\n\nIs it possible the virus has mutated twice in a period of time of months? Of course it is. That's what we expect from coronaviruses. It would be shocking if it did not. \n\nThe default assumption (based on a vast amount of experience with coronaviruses and many other viruses) is that these mutations are neutral and do not affect the virus in terms of fitness, virulence, or transmissibility in any way; they are occasionally useful in tracking sources, but unless you have spent a lot of time looking at virus phylogenetic trees for several years, your interpretations of these mutations are almost certainly wrong.\n\nAn example of people making claims based on unfamiliarity with virus evolution is the \"two different types of the virus\" claim. That claim is addressed by MacLean and colleagues in their Response to “On the origin and continuing evolution of SARS-CoV-2”.

        "question": "I have tried to find an answer to this but have not found anything after multiple attempts.\n\nThe question on the table is if the human body is able to produce an immune response to the COVID-19 virus if one has been exposed? This would apply most specifically to persons that have been tested positive but have \"survived\" (i.e. not having succumbed to the serious lung complications that have caused deaths for some persons). \n\nA follow on question that comes from this is if the human body is able to mount a suitable defense does the current practice of keeping people in quarantine for two weeks allow for this defense to reach full effectiveness? \n",
        "answer": "We probably won't really know for certain until we have time to gather more data from survivors. However, infection with existing coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV, genetically very similar to the COVID-19 virus SARS-CoV-2; ref. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0695-z) suggests that those who are infected and survive may develop temporary immunity (ref. https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/04/two-scenarios-if-new-coronavirus-isnt-contained/):\n\n\n  The toll of a seasonal-flu-like coronavirus also depends on immunity — which is also scientifically uncertain. Exposure to the four endemic coronaviruses produces immunity that lasts longer than that to influenza, Webby said, but not permanent immunity. Like respiratory syncytial virus, which can re-infect adults who had it in childhood, coronavirus immunity wanes.\n  \n  “Everyone, by the time they reach adulthood, should have some immunity to some coronavirus,” said Tim Sheahan, a coronavirus researcher at University of North Carolina’s Gillings School of Global Public Health. But because it doesn’t last, older people can get reinfected. The elderly also have a higher death rate from coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, a pattern 2019-nCoV is following.\n  \n  “There is some evidence that people can be reinfected with the four coronaviruses and that there is no long-lasting immunity,” Dr. Susan Kline, an infectious disease specialist at of the University of Minnesota. “Like rhinoviruses [which cause the common cold], you could be infected multiple times over your life. You can mount an antibody response, but it wanes, so on subsequent exposure you don’t have protection.” Subsequent infections often produce milder illness, however.\n\n\nIt might also be possible that someone was infected with two different strains of SARS-CoV-2 and did not develop immunity from the first infection. But it could have also been a continuation of the first infection, or testing error. Without virus sequence data, it was not possible to determine what happened for certain (ref. https://www.wired.com/story/did-a-woman-get-coronavirus-twice-scientists-are-skeptical/):\n\n\n  What could be worse than getting the pneumonia-like illness now known as Covid-19? Getting it twice.\n  \n  That’s what Japanese government officials say may have happened to a female tour bus guide in Osaka. The woman was first diagnosed with Covid-19 in late January, according to a statement released by Osaka’s prefectural government Wednesday. She was discharged shortly after, once her symptoms had improved. A subsequent test came back negative for the virus. Three weeks later she returned with a sore throat and chest pain and tested again. For a second time, she tested positive for Covid-19.\n  \n  News reports detailing the case raised the possibility that people may not be developing immunity to the new coronavirus, even after they’ve recovered. But several infectious disease specialists say there’s not enough data to support that conclusion. Another possibility is that the virus subsided and flared up again. (Some viruses tend to do that.) Or the test was simply wrong.\n\n\nIf someone was infected twice, comparing the genomic sequences of the virus over time would have helped determine that with more certainty.\n"

        "answer": "Perhaps I can help answer your microbiology question which is really about SARS-CoV-2 which is an enveloped mRNA virus. There is a lot of misunderstanding about SARS-CoV-2 and the medical disease it causes, COVID-19. The confusion is understandable as this is a novel coronavirus with a high rate of transmission &amp; people around the globe are still in a learning curve about it. It's important to understand how to decimate SARS-CoV-2 whenever possible. I'm an RDN &amp; years ago I went to grad school on an Allied Health Traineeship thanks to citizens of the U.S.A. Although now retired, as well as having been a clinician, I'm a former prof. I believe in giving back to society which has supported me.\n\nMany pieces in the press unfortunately use terms of SARS-CoV-2 and then COVID-19 interchangeably, which they should not. This adds to public confusion. Keep in mind that disinfection in this instance pertains to decimation of the virus SARS-CoV-2 per se.\n\nCleaning should precede disinfection. Disinfection is biocidal elimination on fomite surfaces of microorganisms, in this instance SARS-CoV-2. After applying disinfecting dilution be sure to allow it adequate action time and then allow surface to air dry.\n\nWhen CDC says to use “5 tablespoons (aka 1/3 cup) bleach per gallon of water” or “4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water” that is in effect 1000 ppm. CDC guidance assumes household bleach concentration to be 5-6.25%, even though most NaOCl manufacturers int the U.S.A. went to 8.25% back around 2012-2013. Check any bottle you have (or box it came in) for the NaOCl concentration for that batch of bleach. When first manufactured concentration is higher, but over time actual available free chlorine level drops and adequate potency passed by 1 year out from manufacturing date. If stored at higher room temperature, cut that down to 6 months which is more realistic. Adequate 1000 ppm of NaOCl for enough time (minimum 1 minute) can kill SARS-CoV-2.  If the non-porous fomite surface happens to be a countertop where inadvertently later food might be placed on, then after first cleaning, then disinfecting, be sure to rinse with potable H2O, then use a sanitizing solution dilution and allow to air dry.\n\nSee: \"COVID-19 – Disinfecting with Bleach\" from Michigan State U Center for Research on Ingredient Safety which will explain how to read date code of manufacturing on a household bleach (NaOCl) bottle and how much bleach to add to cold water in order to reach what is effectively a 1000 ppm dilution if bleach is still ‘fresh enough’ aka adequate concentration in bottle as purchased. The bleach concentration bottle code information can be read as follows (quoted or paraphrased from article):\nExample: code E619337.\n●First two characters E6 identify the company facility that manufactured the bleach. \n●Second two numbers 19 tell the year the company manufactured the bleach.\n●Last three numbers 337 tell the day of the year the company manufactured the bleach.\nSo, code E619337 tells us this bottle of bleach was manufactured at facility E6 in 2019 on the 337 day of the year (using a Julian calendar), which is December 3.\nThis bottle of bleach technically expires one year from December 3, 2019, so it needs to be used or disposed of by December 2, 2020. \nSimilarly a  product code A420027 tells us the product was manufactured at facility A4 in 2020 on the 27 day of the year, which is January 27. The product expires one year from January 27, 2020, so it needs to be used or disposed of by January 26, 2021. \nAdjust the Julian calendar keeping in mind the year as 2020 is a leap year. \nFrom experience using test strips with bleach concentrate dilutions, often that expiration timeline is closer to 6 months (commercial settings open bottle only 1 month).\ncanr.msu.edu/news/covid-19-disinfecting-with-bleach\n\nPublic Health Ontario has an online \"Chlorine Dilution Calculator\" to help anyone determine how much NaOCl  \"household\" bleach of a given concentration level to add to how much safe tap water to achieve a certain ppm of diluted chlorine sol'n.

SARS-CoV-2 leaked from a lab, in which research on the Bat CoV (RaTG13) was done:\n\nUnlikely, since both viruses share only around 96% sequence homology which translates into more than 1100 sites where the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 viruses is different from RaTG13. The mutations are distributed throughout the viral genome in a natural evolutionary pattern, making it highly unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 is a direct descendant from RaTG13. For comparison, the original SARS-CoV and the intermediate host palm civet SARS-like CoV from which it originated shared 99.8% sequence homology, showing a much closer relation.\n\n2. The S (spike) protein from bat SARS-CoV cannot be used to enter human cells via the human ACE2 receptor and therefore has been adapted in the lab:\n\nThis is untrue, since a 2013 study of a novel bat corona virus was published showing the ability of the virus to enter cells via the ACE2 receptor. See reference 3 for details.\n\n3. The spike protein of SARS-CoV contains a unique inserted sequence (1378 bp) located in the middle of its spike glycoprotein gene that had no match in other coronaviruses:\n\nAs shown in reference 4, the sequence comparision of the SARS-CoV-2 with closely related other corona viruses shows that this sequence is not unique to the new virus but is already present in older strains. It shows some difference due to inserted mutations.\n\n4. The claim that SARS-CoV-2 contains four insertions from HIV-1:\n\nThe paper claiming this has now been retracted due to severe criticism, and additionally a renowned HIV expert published an analysis (reference 5) demonstrating that the HIV-1 claimed insertions are random rather than targeted.\n\n5. The claim that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is completely man-made:\n\nTo design such a \"weapon grade\" virus in the lab, the design would usually start from a known virus backbone and then introduce logical changes (for example, complete genes from other viruses). This cannot be seen in the genome of the virus, rather you see randomly distributes changes throughout the genome coming from virus evolution and not directed cloning. It is more likely that this virus originates from the recombination of a bat CoV (to which it is closely, but not directly related) and another, not yet known CoV in an intermediate host, like the palm civet for the 2003 CoV.\n\nReferences:\n\n\nNo credible evidence supporting claims of the laboratory engineering\nof SARS-CoV-2\nThe proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2\nIsolation and characterization of a bat SARS-like coronavirus that\nuses the ACE2 receptor\nIs SARS-CoV-2 originated from laboratory?

        "question": "TL;DR\n\nWhat's the relationship between the following?\n\n\nMutation rates (expressed as \"mutations per year\" for a virus like e.g. COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). E.g. this article mentions \"The rate looks to be about 24 mutations per year\"\nActual virion replication error rates in a single host cell, measured as e.g. error rates per released virion from the infected cell, i.e. (# of mutated released virions) per infected cell.\n\n\n\n\nAssumptions\n\nI would assume that mutations happen at a single virion-cell level because there are differences in e.g. nucleotides in RNA  between:\n\n\nthe virion infecting a cell (e.g. ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2)\nthe released virions from that same single cell\n\n\nIf so, wouldn't one argue that:\n\n\nreplication errors (at the nucleotide and thus released virion level) can easily happen, potentially billions of times during the infection of a single host organism\nthere is no \"single successful\" mutation or RNA variant within a host, rather, we have a distribution of RNAs, many of which could be simultaneously transmitted to another host organism?\n\n\nFurther context\n\nI quote from e.g. this paper:\n\n\n  On a per-site level, DNA viruses typically have mutation rates on the order of 10E-8 to 10E-6 substitutions per nucleotide site per cell infection (s/n/c). RNA viruses, however, have higher mutation rates that range between 10E−6 and 10E−4 s/n/c\n\n\nAgain, wouldn't that mean that a single host could 1) easily generate many mutations of the same virus and 2) pass most of those uniquely generated mutations to another host? If so, how come we can simply say \"24 mutations (over time) per year\"? \n",
        "answer": "Since no one else has done so, just gonna expand on what occurred here in the comments (mostly from @Alex Reynolds):\n\ntl;dr: natural selection exists.\n\nLonger version:\n\n\nMutations/replication errors/whatever will happen in the creation of new virus particles within a host cell. There is some distribution of number of mutational events that will occur as a function of the number of new RNA molecules created per cell and the replication error rate. Some subset of these RNA molecules will be packaged into new particles, yielding a new generation of viruses that get a chance to infect. Yes, this is potentially a large number of new mutations per infection event.\nSome large proportion of these new particles will contain non-functional RNAs, due to inactivating mutations of one kind or another. Most of the new mutations will be worse at being a virus than the originally infecting virus (their immediate parent). So therefore, they will be outcompeted by non-mutated forms.\nAmong all those viruses which continue successfully infecting throughout the course of a year, on average we observe 24 substitution mutations in the genome over the course of that year. Every transmission chain included in the group of viruses at the end of the year must have remained viable for infection of hosts. In other words, it has survived natural selection.\n\n\nIn population genetics, this phenomenon is known as \"mutation-selection balance\"- e.g. new mutations arise in the population at a rate that is limited by the action of natural selection (at equilibrium).\n\nGenotype-phenotype maps\n\nWhat of course I am leaving unstated is exactly why \"...new mutations will be worse at being a virus than the originally infecting virus...\"\n\nThis is very hard to predict in many cases. In some cases it is very obvious why a mutant is bad at being a virus, if e.g. an essential gene is deleted from the RNA genome. But for many single mutations we don't really understand what their effect will be on virus function, we just observe that they drop out of the population due to negative selection. \n\nIf you are interested in this question, I recommend looking into genotype-phenotype maps. I know Jesse Bloom has done some work on influenza in this field, here is one example of such a paper. It is generally extremely laborious to do this kind of work, so relatively little is known about the functional effect of any specific mutation in any specific genome.\n\nHope it is helpful to have all that written out.\n"

        "question": "I keep hearing people are recovering from COVID-19 virus. Is there any chance that same person can become infected with COVID-19 for a second time? \n",
        "answer": "Short answer: Although there are some reports on this, it is pretty unlikely. It is more likely that patients where released too early from hospital, developed further symptoms later on and got worse, was re-hospitalized, tested again for SARS-CoV2, which was positive and counted as re-infected. \n\nAnother possibility is that a false negative test happened, when people got re-tested later the test was positive again and the patient was counted as re-infected. Given the rising number of cases worldwide this should become evident pretty soon, if this is a real problem and not an artefact. For the moment, I don't think there is enough evidence for the re-infection of the same patient in such a short time period. If this holds, future will tell.\n\nLong answer: There is now an experimental paper, which infected rhesus macaques with SARS-CoV2, tested if the infection was similar to humans happening in the upper airways (which it was), and re-infected the animals after 28 days with a really high dose of virus (which is much higher than what comes around in our environment), with none of the macaques getting re-infected or showing pathological signs of the infection. See reference 1 for details.\nThis article has its limitations with small sample size and the general questions if the chosen animal model is really comparable with human. \n\nAdditionally it looks very much like that patients who are recovering don't shed infectious virus anymore. The PCR test however does not discriminate between infectious virus and plain virus RNA, so it is most like much longer positive than people are infectious. They also show the rapid appearance of specific antibodies, which would at least temporarily protect against a re-infection. See reference 2 for a nice summary and reference 3 for the original article.\n\nReferences\n\n\nReinfection could notoccur in SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques\nPeople ‘shed’ high levels of coronavirus, study finds, but most are\nlikely not infectious after recovery begins\nClinical presentation and virological assessment of hospitalized\ncases of coronavirus disease 2019 in a travel-associated\ntransmission cluster\n\n"

These developmental variations have a spike in changes to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs\n\nHow do they define S and L variations?\n\nThey did population genetics on 103 available SARS-CoV-2 genomes.\nThese two major types are well defined by two SNPs which show complete linkage across the viral strains.\n\nIt also important to mention that SARS-CoV-2 was found to have 96.2% similairty to a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13) but not very similar to SARS-CoV (79%) or MERS-CoV (50%).\n\nHow do we know that there's two type?\n\nWe know there's two types because from the 103 sequenced genomes two SNP locations show significant linkage. These are SNPs at location 8,782 (orf1ab: T8517C, synoniumous) and 28,144 (ORF8: C251T, S84L).\n\nIf you have a \"CT\" (as in base pairs) haplotype SARS-CoV-2 you've got the L-type (\"L\" type because T28,144 is in the codon of Leucine). Otherwise, if you've got a \"TC\" haplotype you have the S-type (C28,144 is in the codon of Serine).\n\nThey found that S-type is the ancient (less aggressive version) by aligning it with other older viruses. In fact for each variant of the virus the ancestral state was inferred by alignments of SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512), RaTG13, and GD Pangolin-Cov.\n\nSo to be more precise on my answer for finding S and L types. You sequence the genome of an infected individual (you can find these online on NCBI) align it with the current reference sequence (MN908947, NC_045512), look at the SNPs and figure if they have a \"CT\" or \"TC\" haplotype to determine S or L type.\n"

For the most part, the feeling is once you’ve had a specific coronavirus, you are immune.

I am not aware that this exist at the moment and I don't think anyone had the time to do it for immunostaining purposes.\n\nFor FISH it would depend on the genomic nature of the virus (ssRNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, dsDNA), again you would need specific probes to capture it. Again specific is key.\n\nEDIT 01.04.2020: This group says they have found specific antibodies https://www.centivax.com/covid19\n"

        "question": "Multiple groups of scientists are trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine but they are not yet being fruitful. What challenges or difficulties are there in the process that slowing down and/or causing failure in development of vaccine?\n",
        "answer": "There are multiple challenges presented, and many of those are not limited to coronavirus vaccine.\n\nAs mentioned above, it just takes time. Before a vaccine can be used in patients, clinical trials must be performed to validate the safety and efficiency of the vaccine candidate. A Clinical trial includes three phases, which again, just takes time.\n\nBut to really answer your question, what are some challenges of developing a vaccine?\n\nTo begin with, from the perspective of lab research, we first need to develop a vaccine candidate. What protein on the virus should we take as an antigen? There are many many proteins on the virus, and for CoV, we know it is a protein called Spike protein. It is the neutralizing target on the virus. Which means, when an antibody bound to this site, it could prevent the virus from infecting the cells. Okay, then we have to know, do we need to do something to this protein to make a vaccine? For example, when we try to manufacture this protein into a vaccine, what if the protein is degraded? Or it somehow becomes a 'bad' protein that simply cannot stimulate immune responses in human? These are just some examples of roadblocks of developing vaccine.\n\nLet's suppose we finally work those out. Then what's next? Each candidate vaccine needs to be tested in animals before going into human clinical trial. This step is time-consuming.\n\nNow we are finally ready to start clinical trials. According to FDA, the vaccine for human trials (also for each drug) needs to be produced under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). It's basically a standard operating procedure to make sure that the vaccine candidate can be manufactured in a large-scale, quality-controlled manner. There are many many challenges, like how to purify the protein? How to scale-up production. This is partly of the reason why the first vaccine in trial in USA is an mRNA, and in China is a DNA, both of which does not require complicated protein purification.\n\nAs you can see, the list of challenges can go on and on. But there are scientists and doctors working diligently on it. Hopefully we'll get there.\n"

        "question": "Coronavirus, HIV, 1918 Flu, etc. They all come from animals. Do any infectious diseases (in humans) come from plants? More specifically, are there viruses that infect plants that can mutate to infect humans?\n",
        "answer": "Question\n\n\n  “Are there viruses that infect plants that can mutate to infect\n  humans?”\n\n\nAnswer\n\nNone appear to have been reported so far. It is difficult to provide supporting evidence for an assertion that they do not exist, but a recent review on the relationship between plant and animal viromes does not include any examples, and our general understanding of the mechanisms by which viruses infect organisms and cells suggest that this is unlikely. There are, however, examples of plant viruses replicating in the insect vectors that transmit them.\n\nEvidence\n\nIn 2011 Dolja and Koonin of the NIH published a review in Current Opinion in Virology 1 322-331 entitled Common origins and host-dependent diversity of plant and animal viromes. In this they considered: \n\n\n  “…three distinct scenarios for the origin of related viruses of plants\n  and animals: i) evolution from a common ancestral virus predating the\n  divergence of plants and animals; ii) horizontal transfer of viruses,\n  for example, through insect vectors; iii) parallel origin from related\n  genetic elements.”\n\n\nThe very fact that there was a need to argue for a relationship indicates the assumed distinction between animal and plant viruses, and indeed they write:\n\n\n  “…plants are not known to support reproduction of dsDNA viruses and\n  retroviruses.”\n\n\nThe only reference in the whole article to an actual biological relationship between animal and plant viruses is the following:\n\n\n  “Strikingly, viruses of the order Mononegavirales and the family\n  Bunyaviridae… can also reproduce in their arthropod vectors.”\n\n\nThe paper referenced in support of this statement is by Hogenhout et al. and was published in the Annual Review of Phytophathology (2008) 46 327–359, and is entitled Insect Vector Interactions with Persistently Transmitted Viruses. From this it emerges that there is a class of plant viruses called persistent propogative viruses which replicate in the circulation of their insect vectors, in contrast to most types of circulative viruses. The insects involved include the leafhopper (illustrated below in Fig 1 from that review) and the thrip.\n\n\n\nSchematic representation of persistent virus transmission by a leafhopper. Viruses that are transmitted in a circulative persistent manner do not replicate in the insect and usually enter the salivary glands from the hemolymph. In plants, replication of circulative viruses is frequently restricted to the phloem tissues. In contrast, most propagative viruses replicate in several plant tissues and in different organs of the insect vectors ( yellow arrows) and may enter the salivary glands either from the hemolymph or from other connecting tissues, e.g., the nervous system or trachea. \n\nIt is not clear to me whether the virus is in any way detremental to the insect vector — certainly it is not the primary target of the virus, and replication can be regarded as allowing it to survive longer before the insect transmits it to the plant.\n\nToday insects, tomorrow people?\n\nThe very fact that persistent propogative insect viruses can replicate in their animal vectors raises the question whether the insects could somehow transmit them to human beings. In an answer to a different question on whether insect pathogens can infect humans I have argued that the absence of examples in situations where people come into close contact with insects and the  difference in anatomy and molecular structure of cell membranes makes this unlikely. In the present case we are not even talking about an insect pathogen, but a plant pathogen.\n"

Basically touching, inhaling and of course consuming it is very toxic.\n\nOn the other hand 70% alcohol solutions are found in most hand and surface sanitizers which are usable against COVID-19.\n\nSo my question is: how much should I be afraid when cleaning surfaces with my small 70% spray bottle? Since alcohol evaporates, I'd be naturally inhaling it, I mean where else could it go in the air? I'm also just spraying it on a wipe to clean my mobile, not using a rubber glove for that.\n\nWhat are the health concerns when using such solution?\n",
        "answer": "If you're interested in the biological or health effects of various chemicals, try to look up the Safety Data Sheet, or \"SDS\" or \"MSDS\", for that chemical compound.\n\nGoing to your favorite search engine and plugging in your chemical of interest to the search term \"SDS\" or \"MSDS\" will almost always get you to some kind of answer — either what you're looking for has a safety data sheet or it doesn't!\n\nIn the case of 70% isopropyl alcohol, there are SDSs/MSDSs out there that will tell you what potential health effects are. Here's one example for 70% isopropyl alcohol:\n\n\n  Potential Health Effects\n  \n  Eye: Produces irritation, characterized by a burning sensation, redness, tearing, inflammation, and possible corneal injury. May cause transient corneal injury. In the eyes of a rabbit, 0.1 ml of 70% isopropyl alcohol caused conjunctivitis, iritis, and corneal opacity.\n  \n  Skin: May cause irritation with pain and stinging, especially if the skin is abraded. Isopropanol has a low potential to cause allergic skin reactions; however, rare cases of allergic contact dermatitis have been reported. May be absorbed through intact skin. Dermal absorption has been considered toxicologically insignificant. The cases of deep coma associated with skin contact are thought to be a consequence of gross isopropanol vapor inhalation in rooms with inadequate ventilation, rather than being attributable to percutaneous absorption of isopropanol per se.\n  \n  Ingestion: Causes gastrointestinal irritation with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. May cause kidney damage. May cause central nervous system depression, characterized by excitement, followed by headache, dizziness, drowsiness, and nausea. Advanced stages may cause collapse, unconsciousness, coma and possible death due to respiratory failure. Aspiration of material into the lungs may cause chemical pneumonitis, which may be fatal. The probable oral lethal dose in humans is 240 ml (2696 mg/kg), but ingestion of only 20 ml (224 mg/kg) has caused poisoning.\n  \n  Inhalation: Inhalation of high concentrations may cause central nervous system effects characterized by nausea, headache, dizziness, unconsciousness and coma. May cause narcotic effects in high concentration. Causes upper respiratory tract irritation. Inhalation of vapors may cause drowsiness and dizziness.\n  \n  Chronic: Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause defatting and dermatitis.\n\n\nSafety data sheets sound terrible! But in reality, people use rubbing alcohol with common sense, without putting into their eyes, without drinking it, etc. \n\nMainly the point of this answer is to help you find the answer for yourself, if you want to find out about this or other chemicals you might be worried about.\n"

For example, for influenza, typhoid, cholera and malaria. There are some historical precedents for exposure to very deadly viruses. The thing that demarcates the design that we propose from some of these historical instances is that we feel there is a way to make these trials surprisingly safe.\n\n\nAs an example, there was a challenge trial for malaria performed in 2012. Healthy individuals were bitten by mosquitoes carrying the malaria parasite and then treated with antimalarial therapies. \n\nClinical trials are done under the aegis of government agencies with review and approval processes, some of which are described on the FDA web site. IRBs or Institutional Review Boards provide oversight:\n\n\n  Under FDA regulations, an IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects. In accordance with FDA regulations, an IRB has the authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove research. This group review serves an important role in the protection of the rights and welfare of human research subjects.\n\n"

        "question": "We often get sore throats once or twice a year, and it clears in a few days sometimes without any antibiotics. I was wondering why doesn't our body become immune after clearing a sore throat?\n",
        "answer": " Short Answer \n\n\nIt should be noted that there are many non-pathogenic causes of sore throat, and I would suspect that you are not always distinguishing these causes from actual illness.\n\n\nIn most cases, it would not be possible to build a response (immunological or otherwise) to avoid reacting to these stressors. \n\nBacteria and viruses mutate frequently in ways that make your immune system unable to properly recognize them to ward off initial infection.\n\n\nYour immune system recognizes specific pathogens based on structural characteristics. If those characteristics change when pathogens mutate (which happens fairly frequently), your immune system will not recognize it as readily (or initially at all).  \n\n\n\n Long Answer \n\nSore throat is most commonly attributed to pharyngitis, or the inflammation of the back of the throat called the pharynx.\n\nCauses\n\nSore throats can be caused by many things. (e.g., see here, summarized below):\n\nFirst off, a sore throat can be the result of many things unrelated to illness: \n\n\nAllergies\nDryness\nIrritants\nExcessive talking,singing,shouting,etc.\nMuscle Strain\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n\n\nAs a result, at least 30+% (higher in adults) of reported sore throat cases (and supposedly many more unreported cases) are not due to any type of illness. \n\nFurther, a number of pathogens can cause a sore throat:\n\n\nViruses\n\n\nRhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, adenoviruses, Epstein–Barr, etc.\n(see here for one estimate of relative etiologies). \n\nBacteria\n\n\nA number of bacterial infections can cause a sore throat. The most common is Streptococcus pyogenes (aka \"Strep A\"). \n\n\n\nIt turns out that pathogen-caused pharyngitis is fairly common. Supposedly 10% of adults with sore throats have strep, and around 70% of children pharyngitis cases seen by doctors are either virally or bacterially caused.  \n\n\nHowever, it should be noted that only 20-30% of children and just 5-10% of adults have bacteria to blame for their sore throat, with viral infections being much more common. (source: IDSA).\n\n\nSore Throat Frequency\n\nIt turns out that sore throats are fairly common; Jones (2004) determined that about 7.5% of people have a sore throat in any three-month period. Further, on average, adults get a sore throat two to three times a year and children about five times a year (Tamparo 2011 and Rutter &amp; Newby 2015), so your personal experience is fairly average.\n\nBecause viral causes and non-pathogenic causes make up an overwhelming percentage of overall sore throat cases, it shouldn't be surprising that most sore throats clear up without the use of any antibiotics. \n\nAs for those that are caused by pathogens:\n\nWhy no Immunity?\n\nBacteria and viruses both mutate fairly quickly (see Antigenic Variation, Antigenic Drift and Antigenic Shift), so it shouldn't be surprising that you're capable of having an immune response to pathogens throughout life. \n\n\nIf we consider just strep alone, it mutates/reemerges with improved fitness frequently (e.g., see Bao et al 2016 and their citations)\nAnd see Sanjuán et al. (2010) for a reviewof viral mutation rates. \n\n\nSo not only are there a number of pathogens that can cause sore throat, but each of these pathogens can mutate. That leaves you with a fairly sizable number of potential invaders that can illicit a sore throat. \n\nLet's See How Your Immune System Responds:\n\nYour immune system contains cells that can be split into two broad groups: cells that belong to the adaptive immune system, and cells which belong to the innate immune system. [See here for a simple explanation].\n\n\nInnate Immune system: consists of cells responsible for initial detection of pathogens, recruitment of other immune cells, activation of the complement system, engulfment and (more immediate) destruction of pathogens. \nAdaptive immune system: consists of cells which coordinate to develop a memory of the infections they've seen previously in order to mount a faster, more pronounced immune response to repeat pathogens.\n\n\nDepending on the kind of foreign invasion, two different immune responses can occur in either of these 2 broader \"systems\": either a humoral response involving antibodies or a cell-mediated repsponse.\n\n\n\nA general feature of the immune system is that these mechanisms rely on detecting structural features of the pathogen or toxin that mark it as distinct from host cells (see Chaplin 2010 for a review). The mechanisms permitting recognition of pathogenic/toxic foreign structures can be broken down into two general categories: \n\n\nhard-wired responses encoded by genes that recognize molecular patterns shared both by many microbes and toxins that are not present in the mammalian host. This is the innate system described above.\nresponses that are encoded by gene elements that somatically rearrange to assemble antigen-binding molecules with extreme specificity for individual unique foreign structures. This is the adaptive system described above.\n\n\nAntibodies recognizes a unique/specific molecule of the harmful agent, called an antigen, and binds to it to tag it for immune attack.  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Because the adaptive system is composed of small numbers of cells with specificity for any individual pathogen the responding cells must proliferate after encountering the antigen in order to attain sufficient numbers to mount an effective response against the microbe or the toxin. [Source: Chaplin 2010].\n\n\n\nThis means that you can still experience some mild symptoms due to the invading pathogen. \n\n\n\nThe important take-away from all this, though, is that your immune response relies on structural \"markers\" on pathogens in order to recognize them. This is true for both innate and adaptive immune responses. If the physical/structural properties of a pathogen change (due to antigenic processes and mutations as mentioned above) your immune system will be slower (and possibly ineffective) in responding to an attack.  \n\n\nThe result, then, could be another one of those sore throats...\n\n\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBao, Yun-Juan et al. “Phenotypic Differentiation of Streptococcus Pyogenes Populations Is Induced by Recombination-Driven Gene-Specific Sweeps.” Scientific Reports 6 (2016): 36644.

Risk groups range from 1 to 4.

But https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.00239.2008 reported that high glucose (!) or PKC inhibitors could reduce ACE2 expression.  (but the high glucose was causing kidney injury, which as described above could mean more ACE2...)  The anti-diabetes drug liraglutide increased ACE2: https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/156/10/3559/2422879  To top it all off?  SARS itself decreases ACE2 expression, and this might be part of the process injuring the lungs: https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1267\n\nThis is by no means a complete survey, and there is much I don't understand.  The relationship between ACE2 biology and the emerging COVID-19 risk groups seems apparent - as is the urgent need for research to determine which manipulations to ACE2 expression have positive versus negative effects on the prognosis of that disease.\n\nUpdate: a NEJM podcast today described this biology as 'complicated' link.  It is clearly of interest, but still under investigation.  For example, losartan is presently the subject of two clinical studies news, presumably these ClinicalTrials\n"

Also according to Wikipedia once an animal is effected it lasts, let's say, no longer than for 2 weeks. \n\nIn other words, does it mean that there is a constant population of rabid animals that exists in order to pass this virus from one animal to another every 2 week on the average?\n",
        "answer": "Such viruses have a natural host, which might get sick, but is usually not killed by the virus. From there, the virus can get zoonotic (jump over species barriers) and infect other animals when it comes to contact. For Rabies the reservoir hosts are different, for the US these are bats, skunks and racoons. For more details, have a look on this PDF.\n\nAnother example for this is the SARS virus (a corona virus) which most likely lives in bats naturally and has jumped from there onto birds and from there infected humans. \n"

        "question": "When the Spanish influenza hit in 1918, it struck in two waves. The first wave was typical for a flu virus, targetting mainly elderly people, but the second wave was far deadlier and killed far more young people. How likely is it for something similar to happen with the current coronavirus? Also, wikipedia states that people who contracted the virus during the first wave were immune to it in the second wave. I thought when a virus mutates it usually avoids detection, hence why we need to usually get an up to date flu vaccine annually. Why was this not the case for the spanish influenza?\n",
        "answer": "This is a great biological question! It asks a lot about how empirical science is done in the field of modern biology! I'm glad we encourage such questions from curious people who want to learn more.\n\nMutations are mostly deleterious to begin with. This means that mutant copies of virus only very rarely survive and proliferate. A virus that is deadlier will already be less likely to reproduce, having killed more hosts.\n\nThe current estimated mutation rate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is 24 bases per year. Of those mutations, those to be most concerned about are those which would mutate the proteins specific to this virus. Vaccine development will aim to train the immune system to target those proteins, particularly the S or spike protein.\n\nMutations to those proteins can make potential vaccines less effective. This is why influenza (\"flu\") vaccines, which are produced ahead of the flu season, may not always line up against the more prevalent strains which result.\n\nA recent comment was published in Nature, authored by life scientists and epidemiologists, which goes into your question in more detail, as regards to the novel coronavirus:\n\n\n  In this case and that of SARS-CoV-2, mutations consume the narrative, even though individual mutations seldom become fixed during outbreaks nor modulate complex virological traits. Rather, mutation is a humdrum aspect of life for an RNA virus. Because these viruses employ an intrinsically error-prone RNA polymerase for replication, their genomes will accumulate mutations during every copying cycle. Moreover, these cycles can occur on the order of hours, ensuring that a diverse virus population will be generated within a single infected host. While this amazing capacity to mutate fuels the engine of evolutionary change, most mutations adversely impact some aspect of virus function and are removed by natural selection. (emphasis added)\n\n\nFurther, and more to the original point of your question:\n\n\n  These warnings will probably not halt the question as to whether mutations will arise in SARS-CoV-2, enabling it to spread more efficiently between humans or generate a higher case fatality rate. In response, we can look to the 2002–2003 SARS-CoV epidemic. Large deletions in the open reading frame 8 (ORF8) region and mutations in the spike (S) protein were discovered during the early stages of the outbreak and eventually dominated the epidemic, suggesting that these were adaptations to humans12,13. Based on this observation, some hypothesized that virus genetic changes in part drove the SARS epidemic, but this claim is unsubstantiated14. So, could SARS-CoV-2 adapt in the same way? Yes. Will adaptation precipitate more deaths? Unlikely. (emph. added)\n\n"

Supplemental materials for this paper indicate that all but two of these proteins (nsp7 and nsp13) have amino acid substitutions between SARS-CoV-2 (\"2019-nCoV\" in the paper) and SARS-CoV. \n\nThe gene nsp5 encodes 3CLpro (chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease), so there are differences there. \n\nLiterature suggests nsp5 and other non-structural proteins are potential targets for a number of antiviral therapies.\n\nAnother paper suggests further that lopinavir targets nsp3 products, among other proteins, in use against SARS-CoV:\n\n\n  Lopinavir’s possible target is Nsp3b, Nsp3c, helicase, NRBD or E-channel with the mfScores of –158.050, –189.140, –114.018, –171.127, and –221.785, respectively.\n\n\nThe nsp3 gene contains a papain-like protease 2 (PL2pro) domain. Supplemental materials from the first linked paper suggest nsp3 has a different amino acid sequence between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. \n\nIt might be worth digging into the Wu et al. paper and the raw annotation data to look at what those a.a. substitutions are, to see if that might help in determining why lopinavir is not as efficient at inactivating PL2pro and reducing levels of the novel coronavirus.\n\nIt may also be worth considering the target itself. Going back to the Nature Biotechnology article:\n\n\n  But Erik De Clercq, of the Rega Institute for Medical Research in Leuven, Belgium, says that in searching for or designing effective drugs against COVID-19: “We should stay away from antivirals known to be acting at targets not playing a role in the replication of coronaviruses.” Such drugs include penciclovir, which is targeted at the herpesvirus DNA polymerase, and lopinavir/ritonavir, which are targeted at the HIV protease. Instead, he would favor targeting a virus-specific protein such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, noting that coronaviruses do not contain or use a reverse transcriptase.\n\n"

There are methods to determine the structures of these regular components to high precision, like single particle analysis (eg. zika) and X-ray crystallography (bacteriophage HK97). Other parts of the virus are less consistent, either because they are flexible or because they are produced slightly differently each time. The nucleic acid core is often arranged semi-randomly, and the lipid envelope of many viruses can vary greatly, dependent on the process by which parts of the host cell's membrane is pinched off to create new viral particles. Here's an example of pretty extreme variability of influenza particles, based on what cell type they have infected.

There are molecular clues that your body uses to recognize better whether something is likely a pathogen (that means it should try to build immunity against) and those are some of the additives (known as adjuvants) present in man-made vaccines. \n\nAlso, the route of administration is also important. Things that you eat or breath in are triaged by the waldeyer ring because maybe you just ate something that is alive, but not exactly a pathogen.

Let me start by characterizing the properties that I'd like this data to have.\n\nMath Properties\n\nThe data must be representable as signed directed graphs, which in less formal terms means that I am looking for a network where the connections between the nodes are arrows with a +/- sign associated with them. \n\nThe signed property of the edges must represent a property of the relation between discrete objects that only takes on one of two values. One way to get signed values from quantitative data would be to use the sign function, keeping only the relations whose sign of the quantitative variable were not equal to zero. Another way is to encode Boolean values, where False is - and True is +. I'd like to further clarify that the data should not only conform to this criteria, but should have instances of both positive and negative paths within the data.\n\nThe directed property of the edges mean that we care to distinguish 'A relates to B' from 'B relates to A'; order matters. Both, one, or neither of these relations can hold in these networks between any two nodes A and B. \n\nData Properties\n\nThe data must be analyzable in the sense that I can obtain the data in a form where I can either (1) immediately analyze the data or (2) transform/manipulate the data into a form that I can analyze. As a computer programmer, I'm likely to be able to find packages for (or code for myself) moderately arbitrary transformations as long as they are computable and interpretable.

        "answer": "While this does look like a very nice approach, I would actually argue that there are (almost) no biological datasets, that can be directly used for your algorithm - you can only do a sort of meta analysis using results/predictions based on other datasets.\n\nThe reason for this is that the nature of a signed graph requires you to look at effects that can have opposite directions, which in biology  pretty much restricts you to regulatory functions*. The problem with that is, that is nearly impossible to directly measure regulatory effects. In all cases I am aware of, one has to measure the magnitude of an effect under different conditions and then calculate regulatory interactions based on that data.\n\nThis means any set of regulatory interactions you can put out into your network is already based on a given analysis with inherent assumptions and (potentially) biases.  \n\nThis doesn't make the approach impossible, but I do think, it is something you need to be aware of, especially if you want to use multiple datasets.\n\nAs for actual datasets that would fit well:\n\n\ntranscription factors have already been mentioned in another answer\nother regulatory effects on transcriptions (promoters / enhancers) may also work, though in this case the 'class' of the objects effected (genes/mRNA) is different than the effector\nAnother type of biological network that might fit are metabolic / enzymatic pathways. For these you could either also look at regulatory interactions (which again may be tricky because both proteins and metabolites can have regulatory effects) or maybe also directly at metabolic flow: in this case nodes in the graph would represent metabolites and edges reactions that produce or consume them. The KEGG database has large numbers of metabolic pathways for many different species.\n\n\n\n\n*I was trying to think of other things, but presence/absence of a signal probably doesn't fit and neither does classification into strong/weak signals (i.e. interactions)\n"

        "answer": "\n  If I get infected once with the virus which causes a common cold, does that mean I will not get infected with the same strain of the virus ever in my lifetime? \n\n\nIt depends on quirks of your immune system and the viral load you're exposed to, but in theory (based on vaccination and other studies), presence of the virus will trigger a suppressive response, not to nasal mucosal invasion but to viral replication and cell destruction/inflammation to the degree that you clinically manifest \"a cold\".  \n\nRegarding your quirks,\n\n\n  The persistence of high-titer serotype-specific antibody is associated with protection from infection as well as reduced symptom severity following experimental challenge with the same serotype (52). However, there is little cross-neutralization among serotypes, which presents a challenge to vaccine development, given that there are more than 100 different known HRV serotypes (53). Further support for the role of humoral immunity in the prevention and control of HRV infection was observed in a study of patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia. These patients experienced more frequent and severe HRV infections than their healthy spouses despite the administration of replacement immunoglobulin therapy (54).\n\n\nThat's only the beginning. Immunology is very complex.\n\n\n  To what extent do you think creating a universal vaccine for the common cold could be successful...\n\n\nClose to, if not, zero.\n\nThere are about 120 distinctly different serotypes of rhinovirus which cause the \"common cold\", which could require 120 separate vaccines. Also a significant percentage of \"colds\" are caused by other types of viruses (coronavirus - like tat in China right now, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza and parainfluenza viruses) as well as some bacteria.\n\n\n  Human coronaviruses, members of the Coronaviridae family, were first identified in 1962 and have been particularly difficult to isolate by use of standard cell culture techniques.\n\n\nOne needs to reliably grow a virus before making a vaccine.\n\n\n  Efforts at vaccine development are hindered by the existence of more than 100 HRV serotypes with high-level sequence variability in the antigenic sites.\n\n\nAnd\n\n\n  Compared to patients with coronavirus-associated colds, there is no difference in respiratory symptom severity or duration.\n\n\nHowever, there is a light at the end of the tunnel: the older you get, the fewer new viruses you're exposed to (if you stay in one geograpical location), and the fewer colds you get.

        "question": "According to the data on the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Tracker, as of 3rd February 2020 there were 17491 confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, 536 total recoveries and 362 deaths.\nFrom my non-expert calculation this implies a mortality rate of:\n\n(Nd / (Nd + Nr)) * 100 = 41%\n\nwhere:\n\nNd is the total number of deaths,\nNr is the total number of full recoveries.\n\nThis leaves 16593 people still suffering from the disease who have neither recovered or died.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the publicly disseminated value of ~2% mortality, so have I made a mistake in my calculation or assumptions, or is COVID-19 much more dangerous than commonly claimed?  \n\n[After a helpful discussion in the comments, 'mortality rate' is not the correct term to use here, instead I should say 'Case Fatality Rate'.]\n",
        "answer": "The definition of mortality rate that you've given does not match any practical definition I'm familiar with.*\n\nWhen people talk about the mortality rate of a disease, what they usually mean is the case fatality rate or the death-to-case ratio, which is simply defined as Nd /  Ni, where  Nd is the number of deaths attributed to the disease over a given time period and Ni is the total number of new cases of the disease observed during the same time period.  By this definition, the current case fatality rate of 2019-nCov according to your quoted figures is 362 / 17491 ≈ 2.07%.\n\n(The tracker seems to have been updated since you asked your question, and now lists a total of 20679 confirmed cases and 427 deaths, for a CFR of 427 / 20679 ≈ 2.06%.)\n\n*) As a theoretical definition of the mortality rate in the long run, when all infected patients have either died or recovered, it can sort of make sense.  But then it becomes equivalent to the usual definition of the case fatality rate.\n\n\n\nTo compare this with your definition of \"mortality rate\" (as Nd /  (Nd + Nr), where Nr is the number of individuals who have recovered from the disease), we need to start by observing that there's no single universal and unambiguous definition of what \"recovering from a disease\" means.  Commonly used definitions tend to be something like \"no symptoms for X days\" and/or \"viral load below N particles per mL for X days\" or simply \"whenever a doctor declares that you're healthy again and lets you out of the hospital\".\n\nNow, let's say that we're using a (somewhat) objective definition of recovery like \"no detectable symptoms for two days\".  The first observation is that any epidemic first observed less than two days ago would, according to your definition, inevitably have a mortality rate of 100% simply because none of the people infected so far would have had time to be considered definitely recovered yet.  (That is assuming that at least one person had died from the infection; otherwise both the numerator and the denominator would be zero, and the rate thus undefined.)\n\nFurther, even after some of the earliest cases have been symptom-free long enough to be counted as recovered, your definition would still yield a highly upwards biased estimate of the \"true\" long-term fatality rate during the early phase of the epidemic, when the number of new cases per day is still increasing.  This is because, for most infectious diseases, any deaths typically occur when the disease is at its most severe state, whereas those who survive the disease will then experience a gradual decline in symptoms as their immune system succeeds in halting and reversing the progress of the infection.\n\n\n\nFor an illustrative example, let's consider a hypothetical disease with a theoretical 1% long-term average CFR — that is to say, exactly 1% of all (recognizably) infected patients will die of the disease.  Let's further assume that this disease typically takes two days to progress from the initial onset of recognizable symptoms to the state of maximum severity, which is when most of the deaths occur.  After this, assuming that the patient survives, the symptoms gradually decline over the following three days.  As remission is possible (but rare), doctors will generally consider a patient recovered only after showing no symptoms for at least two days.  Thus, a typical case would progress as follows:\n\n\n  onset of symptoms → increasing symptoms (2 days) → peak severity → declining symptoms (3 days) → no symptoms → observation (2 days) → officially recovered (total time: approx. 7 days from onset)\n\n\nor, for the 1% of patients for whom the disease is fatal:\n\n\n  onset of symptoms → increasing symptoms (2 days) → death (total time: approx. 2 days from onset)\n\n\nNow, let's assume that, during the early period of an epidemic when the infection is still spreading exponentially, the number of new cases increases by a factor of 10 every three days.  Thus, during this period, the number of new cases, recoveries and deaths per day might grow approximately as follows (assuming for the sake of the example that exactly 1%, rounded down, of the patients diagnosed on each day will die two days later):\n\n    |     cases     |   recovered   |     deaths    |         |            |  \nday |   new | total |   new | total |   new | total | Nd / Ni | Nd/(Nd+Nr) |\n----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---------+------------+\n  1 |     1 |     1 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |\n  2 |     2 |     3 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |\n  3 |     5 |     8 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |\n  4 |    10 |    18 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |\n  5 |    20 |    38 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |\n  6 |    50 |    88 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |\n  7 |   100 |   188 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |\n  8 |   200 |   388 |     1 |     1 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |       0.0% |\n  9 |   500 |   888 |     2 |     3 |     1 |     1 |   0.11% |      25.0% |\n 10 |  1000 |  1888 |     5 |     8 |     2 |     3 |   0.16% |      27.3% |\n 11 |  2000 |  3888 |    10 |    18 |     5 |     8 |   0.21% |      30.8% |\n 12 |  5000 |  8888 |    20 |    38 |    10 |    18 |   0.20% |      32.1% |\n\n\nAs you can see from the table above, naïvely calculating the case fatality rate as (total number of deaths) / (total number of cases) during this exponential growth period does underestimate the true long-term CFR by a factor of (in this case) about 5 due to the two-day lag time between infection and death.  On the other hand, using your formula of (total deaths) / (total deaths + recovered) would overestimate the true CFR by a factor of about 30!\n\nMeanwhile, let's assume that, after the first 12 days, the growth of the epidemic saturates at 10,000 new cases per day.  Now the total numbers will look like this:\n\n    |     cases     |   recovered   |     deaths    |         |            |  \nday |   new | total |   new | total |   new | total | Nd / Ni | Nd/(Nd+Nr) |\n----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---------+------------+\n 13 | 10000 | 18888 |    50 |    88 |    20 |    38 |   0.20% |      30.2% |\n 14 | 10000 | 28888 |    99 |   187 |    50 |    88 |   0.30% |      32.0% |\n 15 | 10000 | 38888 |   198 |   385 |   100 |   188 |   0.48% |      32.8% |\n 16 | 10000 | 48888 |   495 |   880 |   100 |   288 |   0.59% |      24.7% |\n 17 | 10000 | 58888 |   990 |  1870 |   100 |   388 |   0.66% |      17.2% |\n 18 | 10000 | 68888 |  1980 |  3850 |   100 |   488 |   0.71% |      11.2% |\n 19 | 10000 | 78888 |  4950 |  8800 |   100 |   588 |   0.74% |       6.3% |\n 20 | 10000 | 88888 |  9900 | 18700 |   100 |   688 |   0.77% |       3.5% |\n 21 | 10000 | 98888 |  9900 | 28600 |   100 |   788 |   0.80% |       2.7% |\n\n\nAs you can see, the two measures of mortality rate do eventually start converging as the growth of the epidemic slows down.  In fact, in the long run, as the majority of patients either recover or die, they do both end up converging to the \"true\" long-term case fatality rate of 1%.  But by then, the epidemic will be basically over.\n\nThere are various ways to obtain a more accurate estimate of the long-term fatality rate even during the early exponential growth phase of an epidemic.  One such method would be to look at the outcomes of a single cohort of patients diagnosed at the same time.  For our hypothetical example epidemic, looking e.g. at just the 1000 patients diagnosed on day 10, we could get an accurate estimate of the CFR by day 12 simply by dividing the 10 deaths within that cohort by the total number of patients in the cohort.  Furthermore, observing multiple cohorts would give us a pretty good idea of how long after diagnosis we would need to wait before the estimated case fatality rate for each cohort gets close to its final true value.\n\nUnfortunately carrying out this kind of cohort analysis for 2019-nCov would require more detailed information than the tracker you've linked to provides.  Even the time series spreadsheet the tracker links to doesn't directly provide such detailed cohort data, although it might be possible to obtain better estimates from it by making some more or less reasonable assumptions about the typical progress of the disease.\n\n\n\nAddendum: A few preliminary cohort studies of the kind I describe above do appear to have already been published for 2019-nCoV.\n\nIn particular, \"A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern\" by Wang et al. and \"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\" by Huang et al., both published on January 24 in The Lancet, note that, out of the first 41 patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV before Jan 2, 2020 in Wuhan, six had died (and 28 had been discharged, leaving seven hospitalized) by Jan 22, giving a case fatality rate of 14.6% in this cohort.\n\nHowever, they do advise treating this figure with due caution, noting a number of reasons (besides just the small number of cases examined) why it may not fully reflect the eventual long-term CFR:\n\n\n  \"However, both of these [CFR] estimates [of 14.6% from the 41 patient cohort and of 2.9% from all 835 cases confirmed at the time of writing] should be treated with great caution because not all patients have concluded their illness (ie, recovered or died) and the true number of infections and full disease spectrum are unknown. Importantly, in emerging viral infection outbreaks the case-fatality ratio is often overestimated in the early stages because case detection is highly biased towards the more severe cases. As further data on the spectrum of mild or asymptomatic infection becomes available, one case of which was documented by Chan and colleagues, the case-fatality ratio is likely to decrease.\"\n\n\nThere's also a later paper titled \"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study\" by Chen et al., published on Jan 30, that examines a cohort of 99 patients diagnosed between Jan 1 to Jan 20 and reports a CFR of 11% within this cohort.  However, the study only followed these patients up to Jan 25, by which time more than half of them (57 out of 99) still remained hospitalized.\n"

See CDC website for detailed info on this aspect.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html\n\nI quote (as of February 27, 2020):\n\n\"Q: Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?\n\nA: It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.\"\n"

        "question": "Can a full-head helmet with the visor closed prevent getting infected by the Corona virus during a casual interaction with a carrier?\n\nFor example, when buying something at a store or discussing something with someone for 10-15 minutes.\n\nHow does it compare with the protection provided by a standard face mask (that can be purchased at a pharmacy)?\n",
        "answer": "I think it's a great idea. It protects your eyes from respiratory droplets and keeps you from touching your face. I don't know how well it would work from keeping droplet from reaching your mouth, but probably pretty well, especially if you used it with an N95 respirator. It might be a little shocking/intimidating to people, so I would only use it in extremely infected areas. \n"

        "question": "In China, the largest number of reported COVID-19 infections was in Hubei province.\n\nOther countries are experiencing exponential increase in reported infections, while the remainder of China is reporting relatively small numbers of casessource_1\n\nWhat protects Chinese provinces other than Hubei from COVID-19 outbreak?\n\n\nWhat is different about the remainder of China compared to the rest of the world?\nIs there anything we can learn from the provinces in China that so far were less affected by the virus than Hubei?\n\n",
        "answer": "I live in Guangdong, and this is what I've been seeing &amp; reading about.\n\nWuhan (city in Hubei) is where the outbreak supposedly began. And it went unnoticed for a while, which mean it was spreading locally more-so than it was spreading nationally/internationally. Near at the start of the Chinese New Year holiday, the government decided to quarantine all of Hubei province. So while other provinces already had infected people, they spread hadn't grown as significantly as it had in Hubei yet.\n\nThe Chinese government then decided to take specific measures to control the epidemic. For starters, they required mask-wearing and encouraged staying indoors. They also began to set up body temperature checks all over the place (apartments, neighborhoods, roads leading into cities, and places of work once the holiday ended. Fever seems to be the first symptom, so this is why).\n\nIf anyone in an apartment building was confirmed to have the virus, then the entire building and all residents were/are quarantined for 14 days (happened to a 30+ story apartment building next to mine). Elevators, doors, and other public spaces are often disinfected, particularly if a suspected case had been in the area. Again, I saw this at a temperature checkpoint, someone must've had a fever and a little bit later some folks came and sprayed down the area.\n\nSchools are also closed in all provinces across the country, and students are doing online schooling. Some companies are also allowing employees to work from home, or 'staggering' their work days (half come in into the office on Mon, Wed, Fri, the other half come in Tuesday and Thursday). This decreases the number of people a possible infected person can pass the virus to.\n\nOn top of this, companies needed to 'apply' to be able to resume work. Here in Shenzhen, nobody could return to work within 14 days of returning from the city, assuming they left during the holiday. We also need to record down our body temp when coming to and leaving from work. According to an SMS I received from the local government, if 2 employees have a body temperature >= 37.3C, then it needs to be reported immediately, as it indicates a possible spread in that workplace.\n\nIn short, the virus was able to take a foothold in Hubei, and it was noticed before it took a significant foothold in other provinces. Therefore other provinces had time to implement proactive and preventative measures, before the situation grew to Hubei-level of significance.\n\nThe best way to prevent it from spreading is simple steps, such as not going outside unless its necessary, avoid close contact with others (defined as within 6 feet for an extended period of time), washing your hands, and disinfecting often-touched surfaces like door knobs, keyboards, cell phones, etc. It remains to be seen whether other countries will take the same rather drastic measures that are being taken in China, I suppose it all depends on how bad things get in other countries.\n"

        "question": "There is such piece of the dialog between journalist and the doctor (in the middle of an interview about Coronavirus):\n-If somebody's coughing on the bus should you get off?\n-No, getting off isn't gonna help.\n\nWhy?\n",
        "answer": "There are three possibilities when someone is coughing on the bus:\n\n\nthey don't have Coronavirus -- or even a virus at all. I coughed a lot when my lungs were full of tumours. Some people cough when their asthma is acting up. This is by far the most common case.\nthey do have Coronavirus and are not wearing a mask. You are more than 2 metres away from them. This is most of the bus, even in the unlikely event that someone on the bus is infected. \nthey do have Coronavirus, are not wearing a mask, and are less than 2 metres from you. Droplets may already have landed on you. Getting off will not stop that.\n\n\nWhile on the bus, do not touch your face. When you get off the bus, sanitize your hands or wash them with soap and water if you can. Now it no longer matters whether droplets landed on you.\n\nNotice that the CDC advice doesn't say \"if you find yourself near someone coughing, get away from them as soon as you can.\" Doing so is either unnecessary (first two bullets) or won't help (last bullet - it's too late, but handwashing will save you anyway.)\n"

        "question": "It is my understanding that \"epidemic\" is an abnormally high amount of cases than expected. \"Pandemic\" refers to a epidemic that crosses continents (Please correct my understanding if it is wrong).\n\nMy question is should coronavirus (that is, covid-19) be considered a \"pandemic\" ar this point, or is there some other criteria it would need to fulfill to be considered a \"pandemic\"? Perhaps an organization like WHO would need to designate it as a \"pandemic\"?\n",
        "answer": "note: as can be expected from a dynamic event, this answer has changed a bit. The WHO now considers COVID-19 a pandemic; when this answer was initially written, they did not: see the update at the end.\n\nAccording to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases as reported by CNN:\n\n\n  \"It really is borderline semantics, to be honest with you,\" Fauci said.\n  \n  \"I think you could have people arguing each end of it,\" he said. \"Pandemics mean different things to different people.\"\n\n\nThe word pandemic itself refers to:\n\n\n  an epidemic of disease that has spread across a large region; for instance multiple continents, or worldwide.\n\n\nGiven a broad definition like this one, it seems like yes, you could make a case that this is already a pandemic: COVID-19 is found on all richly inhabited continents and is continuing to spread.\n\nHowever, there are still many places that have few cases compared to the outbreak centers, and only a tiny percentage of the world population is known to have been infected (the latest WHO report covers nearly 91,000 cases, a large number, but a tiny percentage: only 0.0012% of the world population of over 7.5 billion).\n\nBy comparison, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic infected 11–21% of the world population.\n\nOrganizations like the WHO have a more stringent operational definition of \"pandemic\", and none that I am aware of at this point have used the \"pandemic\" classification yet in an official pronouncement.\n\nSo, if instead of using a broad dictionary interpretation of \"pandemic\", we say: \"considered a pandemic means a reputable global health organization classifies a pandemic\", then the answer is:\n\nNo, COVID-19 is not yet considered a pandemic as of March 3rd, 2020.\n\nUltimately, it doesn't really matter whether the pandemic term is applied or not. It makes most sense to think in terms of actual numbers and the situation \"on the ground\", and to compare those to past outbreaks rather than worrying about the definition or declaration of \"pandemic.\"\n\nUpdate March 11th\n\nAs of March 11th, 2020, the WHO now considers COVID-19 to be a pandemic. Consistent with this answer, the WHO stresses that this doesn't really change their guidance:\n\n\n  \"Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change WHO’s assessment of the threat posed by this #coronavirus. It doesn’t change what WHO is doing, and it doesn’t change what countries should do\"-\n  @DrTedros\n\n"

        "question": "Today the CDC released an official list of what kills the COVID-19 virus but the list does not mention 70% isopropyl alcohol.\n\nThis is a fairly basic disinfectant and it seems it should have been on the list assuming it kills the virus and that is why I am asking. Thank you\n",
        "answer": "Yes, it does.\n\nAccording to the CDC, this is how surfaces should be disinfected:\n\n\n  Surfaces\n  \n  \n  Wear disposable gloves when cleaning and disinfecting surfaces.

        "question": "The last days (begining of March 2020) active cases of Coronavirus from China dropped in a rate of 1,000-2,000 per day. China is the only country which is being able to reduce the amount of active cases, assuming the information which is coming from China is true. \n\nIs there any identified policy China is doing to succesfully reduce Coronavirus cases, the other countries arent using?\n",
        "answer": "Containment\n\nThe most important factor is containment:\n\n\nIn the epicenter 60 million people were locked down. So if you can't leave your home you can't infect others nor get infected by others.\nAcross the country 780 million people were under travel restrictions.\nSome areas only one family member is allowed to leave the home every 2 days to get supplies.\nCommunity Committees (non existent in most other countries) deliver food and check on condition of those locked down.\n\n\nToday China is changing into \"targeted containment\" where certain cities with no new cases for five days still have borders closed but allow citizens to now move freely within city borders.\n\nSome other considerations:\n\n\nChina is very nimble in setting up a 1,000 bed hospital in a week (16 were setup I believe).\nChina was quick to develop a 15 minute test kit for Novel Coronavirus]2. This allows infected people to be quickly separated and allows those not infected to continue without undue fear or restrictions on work, school or family relations. By comparison US refused (for a week) to test people in a deadly infected Washington State Nursing Home where at least 50 staff in inmates, um er residents, are showing symptoms.\nCT scans. When labs could no longer keep up to number of test samples, hospitals in China resorted to cat scans of the lungs as reported February 13th. There have been no reports in the media if US hospitals have CT scanning machines that doctors know how to read to classify a patient as \"presumptive positive\". There was mild upheaval when China included CT scan cases in their daily reports.\n\n\n\n\nWhat \"we\" started doing March 8, 2020 similar to China\n\nYou don't say who \"we\" are but I presume it is EU / North America. From that point of view Italy has just implemented a policy a little less strict than China today. The daily link contents will change tomorrow so I'll include March 8, 2020 (GMT) link contents here:\n\n\n  ITALY EMERGENCY MEASURES\n  \n  16 days after the beginning of the outbreak, the Italian government\n  took decree today to take exceptional measures to contain about 16\n  million Italians living in 14 provinces in the north of the country,\n  as well as restrictive measures covering the whole country. [source]\n  \n  Northern Italy under lockdown\n  \n  (... SNIP original March 8, 2020 post shortened on March 12, 2020...)\n  \n  \n  Sports competitions are suspended with some exceptions\n  \n\n\nHad the national restrictions been implimented a fortnight ago the lockdown may have been less severe today (March 8, 2020). \n\nAlso note like China, Italy has been using the 15 minute test kit presumably backed up by the two to five day lab testing which they say is more accurate.\n\n\n\nMarch 9, 2020 update\n\nToday Italy expanded the \"lockdown\" to the entire nation of 60 million people. Still it isn't as targeted a restriction as China implemented against Wuhan and the province it was in (circles of protection like Linux Kernel and User Space tools).\n\nToday Israel announced all people coming into the country must undergo 14 day quarantine. This would include all Americans who historically have been the biggest supporters and creators of Israel.\n\nNote Israel's actions go above and beyond the steps China has taken. It more akin to the steps some regions took during the Spanish Flu of 1918. Sorry direct link not available I recall researching this a few days / week ago.\n\nAlthough Israel is using a stronger tactic than which China took two things have to be considered:\n\n\nPeople weren't swarming to get to China in February 2020 with USA\ndeclaring it Persona Non-Grata in nation terms.  \nBenjamin Netenyahu is facing American Style impeachment and might be using people and this growing pandemic as a \"human shield\" of sorts from his personal problems.\n\n\nI think the 15 minute field test kit which takes blood sample was what made China successful but only they can answer that and the MSM I have access to isn't asking those questions to seek answers. Currently schools are closing down in USA and other western countries because someone came back from an infected country without giving them a 15 minute field blood test first.\n\n\n\nMarch 10, 2020 Update\n\nCorrection to yesterday\n\nI read in Haeratz (sp?) Newspaper online today that Netenyahu exempted Israeli's returning from America from the 14 day quarantine. I don't believe any science backs up the fact returning from a special mission to America exempts one from the Coronavirus.\n\nLab tests can fail too\n\nAlarmingly in Japan someone infected on the Princess Cruise ship and then cleared for release was still infected because 15 minute blood test wasn't done, just the swab lab test. Note the link is only valid for 24 hours then you have to scroll to March 10:\n\n\n\nChina developed the 15 minute field test kit on January 31, 2020 and an American company claims to have developed the same 15 minute field test kit. Both are banned by the American CDC though because it measures those who have antibodies fighting the CoronaVirus (stage 1) and antibodies that have defeated the Coronavirus (stage 2). It does not test for the Coronavirus itself.\n\nIf you know who has defeated the Coronavirus and have antibodies they are the safest people to have assisting the at risk segment of the population. China nor any other country has said they are doing this though.\n\nScreening everyone crossing the land/air/sea border with a 15 minute test would go a long way to slowing down the virus spread. I hope the reason for not using the 15 minute test isn't because there isn't enough profit in it for labs. Remember to date \"our\" labs have mostly test people who don't have the virus. With the 15 minute test kit they would be testing people who 90% odds do have the virus.\n\nNew Rochelle New York State takes a page from China's play book\n\nTomorrow the Army is moving into New York according to Aljazeera TV to seal off the city and not let anyone leave. Plus they will distribute food to those in quarantine which mimics what China's community committees were doing as posted earlier.\n\nThis disease for America and EU is unique in that the \"jet-setters\" / wealthy like the rich Northern region of Italy (initial ground zero) are the global spreaders of the disease (besides local transmission which takes of a week or two later).\n\nThe downfall of this lockdown in New York state is it is announced two days before it takes effect giving infected people time to flee and infect others. Had those fleeing been tested it would have mitigated / reduced the chances of virus spread.\n\nTo Mask or not to Mask that is the question.\n\nCoronavirus: put a surgical mask on, Hong Kong welfare chief Law Chi-kwong told\n\nA survey of nurses in America recently revealed many of them were never trained on how to put on PPE yet this is construction worker safety 101 (at least it was when I was working in construction and not warehousing).\n\nGreen/Yellow/Red barcodes\n\nChina is using colour coded identification for people in Wuhan (ground zero) according to Aljazeera just now. Green = good to go, Yellow = warning, Red = No go. The government controls colour code assignments it was not reported how the colour codes are derived but it might be beneficial for other nations' red-tape departments to learn.\n\n\n\nMarch 11, 2020 Update\n\nToday Italy changed the lock-down to a shutdown:\n\n\n  Italy closes all commercial activities, offices, cafes, shops. Only\n  transportation, pharmacies, groceries will remain open\n\n\nThis sounds a lot like what China did for Wuhan and surrounding area.\n\nToday the WHO (World Health Organization) declared the New Coronavirus (circa 2019) a global pandemic in hopes it will spur \"our\" governments to take more aggressive measures to contain the virus. In other words to be more like China which is what the OP is asking above.\n\nUSA announces all flights from Europe will be cancelled\n\nEffective Friday March 13th the USA will ban all flights from Europe. The more important thing would be to track down all people who arrived from Europe over the last 14 days and test them. Flights from UK are still allowed but no word if Chunnel will be closed. UK has not announced a vote for CVexit.\n\n\n\nMarch 12, 2020 Update\n\nCanada's Prime Minister\n\nThe wife of the Prime Minister of Canada is suspected of being infected from in the United Kingdom on a speaking engagement (a high risk adventure IMO):\n\n\n  In a press release on Thursday, the Prime Minister’s Office said she\n  has received a test for the new coronavirus after her symptoms emerged\n  last night following her return from a trip to the U.K., where she had\n  been doing speaking engagements.\n  \n  While the prime minister has no symptoms, he is self-isolating until\n  her test results are back.\n  \n  “The doctor’s advice to the prime minister is to continue daily\n  activities while self-monitoring, given he is exhibiting no symptoms\n  himself. However, out of an abundance of caution, the prime minister\n  is opting to self-isolate and work from home until receiving Sophie’s\n  results,” the release said.\n\n\nThe Prime Minister's Doctor gave the wrong advise. At my workplace yesterday they announced a coworker was being tested (4 days for results) and is self isolate because his wife works with a Doctor who had tested positive. So we have two health \"professionals\" the one in Ottawa Canada playing fast &amp; loose, the one in Edmonton Canada erring on the side of caution.\n\nEveryone at work is worrying now. I wish we had the 15 minute field test kit so we can quickly separate the \"suspected wheat\" from the \"suspected chaff\". The good news is unlike the USA we can do tests on possible cases here in Edmonton Canada. Tom Hanks is also thankful today he could be tested in positive Australia and wasn't in the USA would they would refuse to test him.\n\nChina is a surveillance state which can control social media and MSM for sure. Canada and USA could utilize the anti-terrorism network built a decade ago including no-fly lists and turn it into a \"anti-coronavirus\" network. Another example of what \"we\" could be doing more like China using existing computer databases and surveillance tracking resources.\n\nWhat Alberta announced today\n\nEDMONTON -- As part of a new aggressive measure to fight the coronavirus pandemic, Alberta is cancelling all large gatherings and advising against international travel. Furthermore the link states:\n\n\n  The province is advising Albertans against travelling\n  internationally.\n  \n  \"Given the rapid spread of this virus, it is no longer possible to\n  assess health risks for the duration of the trip,\" Hinshaw said.\n  \n  She is also recommending all Albertans currently outside of Canada to\n  self-isolate for 14 days after their trip.\n  \n  Hinshaw said the risk of contracting coronavirus in Alberta has not\n  changed in the past 24 hours, but is concerned that international\n  travellers will continue to bring the disease into the province.\n\n\nWith only 23 confirmed cases Alberta is taking early steps to contain the virus without overreacting. The next steps (if cases increase) would be to close beauty parlours, bars and restaurants but I'm biased as I never frequent such establishments. Also I would stop sending fire fighters to non-essential traffic accidents and paramedic responses to save them for well, fighting fires. Random thought would be for Alberta to have disposable surgical gloves at self-serve gas stations for patrons to don before grasping the nozzle to fill up the tank.\n\nAnother possible step would be to begin skype (TVOIP) talks with Canadian Military which has a base close to Edmonton with feasibility of \"drafting\" Canadian troops living there. The purpose is for embedding troops with Edmonton Peace Officers and Edmonton Police in a combined \"counter-coronavirus-force\" under a central command and control.\n\nWhy troops? It was what my first bus driver after work (I take four buses home after work and am concerned they will shut down in two to three weeks and I'll have to buy a bicycle) said today: \"I hope the banks don't run out of money. This led to a long explanation about fractional reserve banking, gold standard, four Federal Reserve Central banks going bankrupt, currency generated digitally and how not enough real money exists. Anyway more fire power is preferable to not enough when you need it. Besides even if heavy weaponry isn't needed you can always call it a drill and lets face it NATO military doesn't see much \"action\" anyway and will enjoy the \"call to arms\" if nothing else.\n\nStaying on topic, there are no reports I've read that China took these steps and used the military but I \"imagine\" they would have.\n\n\n\nMarch 14, 2020 Update\n\nGetting downvotes so might have to end these \"Save the World who doesn't care Q&amp;A\" updates.\n\nToday Italy announced:\n\n\n  Italy's health system is overwhelmed:\n  \n  \n  \"We're close to the point of no return for intensive care beds in Lombardy. We have 15 to 20 intensive care beds left. With 85 new\n  people entering ICU every day and 2 or 3 leaving, we're close to the\n  point of no return. \"There are no more ambulances\" - Lombardy Welfare\n  Councilor Gallera added - \"and therefore someone will have to wait\n  late in the evening.\" [source] 732 patients are currently treated in\n  intensive care in Lombardy, and 76 new deaths were reported in the\n  region today.\n  In Bergamo, \"deaths have quintupled from a week ago. There is a burial every half hour\" said Councilor for Cemetery Services Giacomo\n  Angeloni. \"There are many elderly people at home with breathing\n  difficulties. They are not hospitalized because the hospitals are\n  full\" said the mayor of Alzano Lombardo Carmelo Bertocchi.\n  \n\n\nWhat would China do?\n\nHard to say their society is different. What should Italy do? Easier to say if they are like Canada.\n\nTemporarily suspend medical laws. Commandeer white crew cab pickup trucks from dealers at cost plus twenty. Paint red crosses on left and right. Staff with four able-bodied young men. Put a mattress in the box.\n\nTake that 80 person call center designed to rip off seniors with calls to support the Fireman's Burn Unit and Police feed the children fund. Have them call people over 65 twice a day. If they don't answer send aforementioned four men in a pick up truck.\n\nA week ago China would have build 1,000 bed hospitals that take a week to complete. NATO countries should do the same a week before where Italy is today. Scrap white collar surveyors, architects and engineers. Send in the blue collar labourers, concrete finishers, electricians, plumbers, skid steer operators, truck drivers, crane operators, foremen and carpenters with blue prints that China used.\n\nSpain's lockdown today should have exempted warehousing and transportation of food and drugs workers. They will think of that tomorrow.\n\nPresident Trump's test announced today seems like \"fake news\" if the test only works when upper respiratory tract is infected when a nasal swab is taken. However the kind of test taken was not announced.\n\nChina web guru is donated 500,000 test kits to USA today. No word if 100 labs and 1,000 lab workers are included to analyze test results...\n\nI visited the world's second largest mall today. I noticed the indoor hockey rink was closed (like the NHL (I could fix that in a week I think)) and replaced with a bead trinket / fake rock sales flea market. One vendor had a dry cough and another was wearing surgical gloves.\n\nThere was a sign outside the bathroom hallway from Alberta Health advising people how to wash hands. At Galaxy land I saw a few amusement ride employees cleaning surfaces. So if they close all the schools here they end up in Galaxy land?\n\nSchools should stay open because teachers know their students better than a random ride attendant. However reinstate the old days where students queue when the first bell rings. Then forehead point and shoot temperature checks will be done.\n\nAllergy season is arriving and probably 10% of the population is effected with running nose and sneezing. They should get a card or something to alleviate the fears of others on the bus or airplane.\n\nPeople under 30 getting and recovering from BSC should be verified and coveted. Being over 50 I'm not really scared but I'm worried I'll infect that elderly man hobbling down the street today at -20C with his cane. My bus may be no safer for him than ETS DATs. Which reminds me shouldn't they be cleaning the buses here?\n\nCallous individuals surround us and say \"they are old\" lets kill them all with the virus. Forward thinkers will realize they will be old too someday. What would China do? I think they would \"respect their elders\".\n\nGee Jing Ping (Xi Jingping) wore a mask and sat meters away from other officials when he announced Wuhan (Think Washington DC) and Wubie Province (Think Washington State) had overcome the virus (we don't know that is true yet).\n\nOn the other hand Trump and officials wore no PPE and all touched the Mic in some sort of \"speaking is more important than reality\" press conference yesterday (Friday the 13th).\n\nIf someone on the bus wears a mask don't freak out. They may be trying to protect you or chances are they are just scared. Don't pick on them.\n\nI have no idea if all of this transpired in China but their culture is different than NATO's and we must adapt because the end results are what count. Life, Liberty and Freedom can be mutually exclusive. For a few months you will have to give up Freedom to save Life. China did do that and appears to have succeeded today. What will history say about YOU?\n\n\n\nMarch 16, 2020 Update\n\nToday Canada announced closing borders to all foreign nationals except US citizens. What would China do?\n\n\nAbout two weeks ago the border to Washington state would have been sealed off.\nBecause people there flow into B.C. the Alberta / BC border would have been sealed off.\n\n\nWhat to do today to mimic China?\n\n\n100 million people live beside the US / Canada border. They like to make day trips to mimic currency arbitrage and buy goods cheaper in other country. This traffic should be shut down.\nCanadian health care is free, Americans in past have utilized that system, that should be shut down.\nEveryone crossing border by land should be subject to 5 second forehead temperature check with $60 gun. Those with fever must seek medical attention.\nSome border crossing like Edmundston New Brunswick and Madawaska, ME, United States are like their own little country. They can manage their own laws and have to worry about keeping outsiders out of both towns.\n\n\nChina succeeded at first locking down Wuhan City and then Hubie province. Italy tried that and failed. Canada / US appears headed for even bigger failure thinking it will save the economy. Perhaps it will in the short term but more long term planning is still needed:\n\n\nAirlines will ask for bailouts. Tell them to go bankrupt and create new startups in a couple of years.\nEdmonton schools are closing for six months. Send teachers out to work for four months even if it is sanitizing buses. After all you are making parents leave work to child care and still expect them to pay 12 months of school taxes right?\nIt's proposed to pay people unemployment. $800 every two weeks might be fine for 80% of the population but an airline pilot can't live on that if his mortgage and car payments are more than that per month.

        "question": "As of time of writing it's quite common to see headlines about so-and-so who have tested positive for Covid-19, e.g. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau's wife, Sophie, tests positive for coronavirus, officials say\n\nHowever, these articles don't usually say how reliable the testing is. I couldn't find any recent information on it via Google, either (there are some results, e.g. this, but they are old).\n\nHow accurate are the tests? What are the odds that Sophie Trudeau's results are a false positive, or that Justin Trudeau's negative result is a false negative?\n",
        "answer": "Short answer: Sophie Trudeau's positive test may still mean 3 : 1 odds of not having contracted Covid-19, but the odds could also be far more towards having Covid-19.\nJustin Trudeau's negative test almost certainly means he was negative when tested. Of course, should Sophie be positive, that may have changed by now.\n\n\n\nUpdate: I found a web page of the FDA listing tests that have this Emergency Use Approval. Each of them has manufacturer instuctions that list their test results towards the end. Some of the submitted test results use ≈100 negative samples in the clinical evaluation. But there is also one that has only 13 positive cases (all of which were correctly found) in their test - but that one got the emergency approval already early in February.\nThe latest 2 (by Thermo and Roche) used 60/60 and 50/100 cases for their clinical evaluation (all results correct). That gets the lower end of the confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity to 94 - 97 % (with the lower end of the c.i. we'd thus have LR+ >≈ 20 or 17, expected values would be 61 or 51, respectively. For LR- &lt;≈ 1/20 or 1/32 (expected 1/61 or 1/100). \n\n\n\nLong version: Let's do some number juggling and see whether we can extract something useful. The following calculations are based on a somewhat worst-case scenario: the FDA emergency validation guidelines specify outcomes that such a new test in the current emergency situation must meet, and I calculate from the low end of performance that could be expected meet these criteria under somewhat unlucky circumstances.\n\nSo we know minimum performance requirements, but I do not know [yet] how good (= how much better than minimum performance) the tests are.\n\nSensitivity and Specificity\n\nThe starting point would be sensitivity and specificity of the respective test.  I haven't found any published data on these, but the FDA has a Policy for Diagnostics Testing for Coronavirus Disease-2019 that says how labs that develop a test should do an \"emergency validation\". They can then get Emergency Use Approval.  \n\n\nSensitivity tells us: of all truly Covid-19-positive specimen, which percentage is correctly recognized as positive by the test; I'm going to use  87.5 % (see below)\nSpecificity tells us: of all specimen that are truly negative for Covid-19, which percentage is correctly recognized by the test.\n\n\nSensitivity and specificity can be measured by standardized protocols, and they characterize the performance of the test. \n\nFrom a patient's or doctor's point of view, however, they are not very useful numbers as they (we) need the answer to the inverse questions:\n\nPredictive values\n\n\npositive predictive value PPV: given that the test yielded positive, what is the probability that the patient truly has the virus?\nnegative predictive value NPV: given that the test yielded negative, what is the probability that the patient truly does not have the virus?\n\n\nPredictive values can be calculated from sensitivity and specificity together with the prevalence (or, as we are talking about newly infected patients, the incidence) of virus among the tested population. Here's how they go for the assumed sensitivity and specificity:\n\n\nred for positive test outcomes, dark green for negative test outcomes. posterior probability = after the test said something, what is the probability that the test result is correct = NPV for negative test result, PPV for positive test result.\n\nGood estimates of prevalence are often difficult to obtain, because we need the prevalence among those who are tested and that is (and should be) quite different from the prevalence of the disease in the general population. \n\nFor some countries such as Italy, we have numbers of performed tests (Wiki page giving numbers for more countries): as of today (March 14th), they ran 109170 tests and have a total of 21157 cases. Not all tests are for initial diagnosis (AFAIK, a patient is considered cured only after a bunch of tests are negative), but as most cases are still \"fresh\", we may the ratio positive cases : tests run as one surrogate for the prevalence in the tested population. This would be around 20 % for Italy. \n\nFrom the diagram we can then read for a new patient being tested the first time:\n\n\nif the test outcome is positive, chances are ≈ 75 % (or greater as I'm calcluating with the lower end of the possible range from the emergency validation) that the patient really has Covid-19.\nSo, up to 25 % false positives. \nif the test outcome is negative, chances are ≈ 95 % (or greater...) that the patient really does not have Covid-19.\nSo, up to 5 % false negatives. \n\n\nCanada currently reports 25 positive out of a total of 796 tests, so about 3 % prevalence in the tested population.\n\nFor the USA, the CDC reports case numbers and test numbers, currently 1629 cases with (3995 + 15749) tests - but it is not entirely clear to me whether the populations completely coincide. Anyways, I'll use 8 % as guesstimate for prevalence.\n\n| prevalence |  PPV |    NPV | Country/Population | \n+------------+------+--------+--------------------+\n| 3 %        | 26 % | 99.6 % | Canada             |\n| 8-9 % (?)  | 50 % | 98.8 % | USA, Germany       |\n| 20 %       | 75 % | 95   % | Italy              |\n\n\n\nNow that is the population of \"everyone who is tested\". At least for Germany (March 14th) but probably also for Canada and the US, tests are done on people who show symptoms and on people that are known to have had contact with Corona virus cases: if they are found to be positive, they are sent home to quarantine and wait whether they did acutally catch the disease. But we may still say that the \"people who are tested\" population has subpopulations with and without symptoms.\nSo if there are further point of suspicion, say, the patient does cough, we'd say they belong to a high risk subpopulation with higher prevalence of Covid-19 compared to the overall prevalence among tested, so the chance of a false positive would be lower for them.  \n\nThis will change as tests are performed only on people who show symptoms (by now, March 16th, everyone is already  told to stay at home in Germany and self-isolate as well as possible - the test result will not change this in any way).  \n\nHandy for quick calculation: likelihood ratio positive (LR+) and negative (LR-)\n\nIf we express the prevalence as odds (1 : 99 instead of 1 %), LR+ and LR- allow easy back-of-the envelope calculations. \n\nLR+ = sensitivity / (1 - specificity) ≈ 11 or better for our test and \nLR- = (1 - sensitivity) / specificity ≈ 0.05 = 1/20 or better for our test.\n\nso they are indpendent of the prevalence and they tell us how the odds change due to the test: the posterior probability (predictive values) are the the pre-test odds multiplied with the likelihood ratio. In that sense, they tell us how much information we gain due to test (for positive and negative outcomes).\n\nSo, Canada reported odds of 25 positive : 771 negative tests. So for Sophie Trudeau, the odds went from 25 : 771 (or 3 %) to  25 : 771 * 11 = 273 : 771 ≈ 1 : 3 or 25 %. For Justin Trudeau 25 : 771 / 20 = 25 : 15420 ≈ 1 : 617 or 0.16 % of being Covid-19 positive (slight discrepancy to above due to rounding).\n\nOn the other hand, if we start testing more and more people for whom the risk of actcually having contracted the virus is lower and lower, we soon won't be able to draw meaningful conclusions from the test results any more: I'm in Germany, currently the federal info page lists 3800 confirmed cases. Even if we assume that there is a huge dark figure and in reality 20 x as many people are infected* that would be a prevalence in the general population of 0.1 %, the odds are 1 infected : 1.5 mio non-infected. If someone who does not belong to any particular risk group were tested positive, their odds would increase by factor 11, i.e. roughly 1 : 140000. A negative test result would decrease the odds by a factor of 1/20 to 1 : 31 mio. However, both results are of no practical use as they don't change the situation: pre-test situation is \"very unlikely to be Covid-19 case\", post-test situation is still \"very unlikely to be Covid-19 case\".\n\nThis is why, even if there were testing capacities for the whole population, tests don't make sense unless we know there are some risk factors such as some kind of respiratory disease or contact to someone who is known to have the virus. And why it is sensible to say that on slightly suspicious circumstances (= low, but not extremely low prevalence), one should self-quarantine/avoid contact but there's no point in testing [yet].\n\n\n\nDetais on how I estimate sensitivity and specificity\n\n\nThe lab first determines the limit of detection (LoD) for virus RNA. The LoD here is the lowest concentration at which 19 out of 20 replicate tests are positive (that would be 95 % sensitivity, but for samples spiked in the lab, but with a relevant and as difficult as possible matrix such as sputum). \nNext, [leftover] clinical samples are used: \n\n\nAs there may not be any positive samples available, the lab can spike negative samples with virus RNA; a minimum of 20 samples are spiked within a range of 1 - 2 LoD plus 10 samples to cover the remaining clinical range.\nOf these, at most 1 is allowed to have negative outcome (and that must be one in the lower concentration range). Thus, 29 positive out of 30 true positive. \nAlso 30 non-reactive specimens are tested. The policy doesn't say a number of false positives that is permissible, so I'm going to assume that must be zero.  \n\nThe lab can then start with real patient samples. The first 5 positive and the first 5 negative cases must be confirmed by an approved test (and must all match). \n\n\nPooling the 2 \"rounds\" of testing clinical samples, we have:\n\n\n34 (or 35) positive tests out of 35 truly positive specimen -> sensitivity at least 97 % with 95% credible interval 87.5 - 100 %,\nspecficity 100 % with 95% credible interval 92 - 100 %\nThere are additional checks required but they don't help us here.\nSampling errors are not included in this validation.\nI'm not a clinical chemist, but I'm analytical chemist and in general analytical chemistry, that can easily be the dominating source of error. In that case, the above numbers would be useless.\nParticularly the sensitivity may drop over time as the virus mutates. \nTo deal with this, in some cases multiple tests are done (read that in some newspaper article which I don't find at the moment).\nWhen doing multiple tests, tests by different providers are used if possible: as they are developed from different virus samples, this gives a better coverage for mutations in the virus than doing the same test in replicate.\n\n\n\n\n* Very handwavy scenario I derived from the development of case numbers in China after their quarantine/shutdown on Jan 26, assuming an incubation period of 2 weeks and that noone got infected after quarantine started.\n"

I imagine it has to be considerably safer than e.g. grocery shopping. Can the virus remain airborne outdoors for long periods of time?\n",
        "answer": "The long and short of it is that the novel coronavirus can be experimentally aerosolized where it can persist in the air for several hours but a number of studies have failed to detect virus in samples taken from the air of the rooms of patients with active disease.  But virus has been detected in aerosols near bathrooms surfaces indicates that it is spread over a long distance with mechanical assistance (flushing?).  SARS was also spread by one patient with diarhoea with malfunctioning sewer systems aerolized the virus across multiple floors of a building.\n\n\n  Both the Covid-19 and the SARS viruses had an aerosol half-life of 2.7 hours, meaning half the particles drop out of the air after that amount of time, and half of what remains drop out after another 2.7 hours. After a day, roughly nine half-lives, 0.002 (0.2 of 1%) of the original particles remain. As a result, the scientists said, “aerosol … transmission of [the new coronavirus] is plausible, as the virus can remain viable in aerosols for multiple hours.”\n\n\nThe usual spread may be via contaminated surfaces (probably on the cruise ships) and respiratory transmission less so since the rate of symptomatic infection among a patient’s household members was 10.5%\n\nSince you're outside based on the above, the viral load would be miniscule.\n\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-can-become-aerosol-doesnt-mean-doomed/\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v2.full.pdf (not peer reviewed yet )\n"

And if yes, is there any data backed up to defend this?\n\n\nThe reason i'm asking this is because an expert in this field said that the \"data is very week behind this\" and \"it's not going to have a big impact on preventing infection\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw) 43:32 and that the data behind the virus being infected through the eyes is very sparse (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw) 44:00\n",
        "answer": "Here's an article that I found helpful, to understand why washing hands with soap is so helpful, and how it helps (Pall Thordarson is a professor of chemistry at the University of New South Wales, Sydney):\n\n\n  Why does soap work so well on the Sars-CoV-2, the coronavirus and\n  indeed most viruses? The short story: because the virus is a\n  self-assembled nanoparticle in which the weakest link is the lipid\n  (fatty) bilayer. Soap dissolves the fat membrane and the virus falls\n  apart like a house of cards and dies – or rather, we should say it\n  becomes inactive as viruses aren’t really alive.\n  \n  The slightly longer story is that most viruses consist of three key\n  building blocks: ribonucleic acid (RNA), proteins and lipids. A\n  virus-infected cell makes lots of these building blocks, which then\n  spontaneously self-assemble to form the virus. Critically, there are\n  no strong covalent bonds holding these units together, which means you\n  do not necessarily need harsh chemicals to split those units apart.\n  When an infected cell dies, all these new viruses escape and go on to\n  infect other cells. Some end up also in the airways of lungs.\n  \n  When you cough, or especially when you sneeze, tiny droplets from the\n  airways can fly up to 10 metres. The larger ones are thought to be the\n  main coronavirus carriers and they can go at least two metres.\n  \n  These tiny droplets end on surfaces and often dry out quickly. But the\n  viruses remain active. Human skin is an ideal surface for a virus. It\n  is “organic” and the proteins and fatty acids in the dead cells on the\n  surface interact with the virus.\n  \n  When you touch, say, a steel surface with a virus particle on it, it\n  will stick to your skin and hence get transferred on to your hands. If\n  you then touch your face, especially your eyes, nostrils or mouth, you\n  can get infected. And it turns out that most people touch their face\n  once every two to five minutes.\n  \n  Washing the virus off with water alone might work. But water is not\n  good at competing with the strong, glue-like interactions between the\n  skin and the virus. Water isn’t enough.\n  \n  Soapy water is totally different. Soap contains fat-like substances\n  known as amphiphiles, some of which are structurally very similar to\n  the lipids in the virus membrane. The soap molecules “compete” with\n  the lipids in the virus membrane. This is more or less how soap also\n  removes normal dirt from the skin.\n  \n  The soap not only loosens the “glue” between the virus and the skin\n  but also the Velcro-like interactions that hold the proteins, lipids\n  and RNA in the virus together.\n  \n  Alcohol-based products, which pretty much includes all “disinfectant”\n  products, contain a high-percentage alcohol solution (typically 60-80%\n  ethanol) and kill viruses in a similar fashion. But soap is better\n  because you only need a fairly small amount of soapy water, which,\n  with rubbing, covers your entire hand easily. Whereas you need to\n  literally soak the virus in ethanol for a brief moment, and wipes or\n  rubbing a gel on the hands does not guarantee that you soak every\n  corner of the skin on your hands effectively enough.\n  \n  So, soap is the best, but do please use alcohol-based sanitiser when\n  soap is not handy or practical.\n\n"

        "question": "I have been reading about the spread of virus and understand comparisons that are being made with the flu.  The flu propagates through a population with vaccinated people while a new virus has an unvaccinated population.  I would like to understand the limitations of using data from the flu and making inferences to dealing with Covid19 given their populations are fundamentally different.\n\nWhen you look at how contagious a virus is they talk about transmission rates without indicating if the rate is the base rate or the effective rate.  The flu and Covid19 have similar base rates, however 40% of the US population is vaccinated from the flu.  Does that mean that the flu actually has a much higher transmission rate in un-vaccinated people and the average works out to a number similar to Covid19 in an unvaccinated population?  Or does in mean that vaccine doesn't stop the spread as much as it really stops the disease?\n",
        "answer": "Reproduction numbers\n\nFirst of all, the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) refers to the contageous person meeting susceptible people only:  the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. So $R_0$ is not affected by vaccination status (or acquired immunity) of the population, but it includes factors such as being contageous already during incubation period (i.e. while still free of symptoms, how contageous a single virus particle is, how long a virus particle lasts under \"normal\" circumstances, ...)\n\nIn contrast, the effective reproduction number R includes the effects of vaccination, acquired immunity, behaviour and other measures to reduce infection risk.\n\nThe wiki page linked above lists $R_0$ for Covid-19 as 1.4–3.9 and for the Spanish flu of 1918 as 2–3.\n\nNow, for the countries that still have just a few Covid-19 cases and that are just beginning to take measures to slow the spread, the effective reproduction number will be roughly the same as the basic reproduction number: noone is immune yet, and no measures to reduce the number of contacts yet. \n\n\n  Does that mean that the flu actually has a much higher transmission rate in un-vaccinated people and the average works out to a number similar to Covid19 in an unvaccinated population?\n\n\nSort-of, but rather the other way round: it means that the effective reproduction number is lower for the flu even though their $R_0$s are similar. \n\nThis review paper gives an R of about 1.8 for the 1918 flu and about 1.3 for the \"normal\" seasonal flu.\n\n\n\nVaccination\n\n\n  Or does in mean that vaccine doesn't stop the spread as much as it really stops the disease?\n\n\nThat can also happen. Of course, the best and intended outcome of vaccination is that the acquired immunity is sufficient to prevent infection. Which means that the vaccinated person cannot spread the disease. However, not all vaccinatione we have and use achieve this - we still use them if they greatly reduce the severity of the disease. E.g. even with varicella vaccination 10 - 30 % of the exposed to get chickenpox (but even with them, serious disease is avoided). \n\nFor the flu, the difficulty is that new strains appear regularly. This is also the reason why flu vaccination is done annually with a newly developed vaccine while e.g. for MMRV, pertussis, polio boosting with the existing vaccine every 10 years is sufficient (immunity actually may last even longer, up to lifelong*, but that varies by person, and since many vaccines haven't been around that long, we don't know for which that is the case).  In fact, flu strains appear so often that the development of the annual flu vaccine includes educated guesses which strains are going to be important for next season. Sometimes that guess is off. Wikipedia on flu vaccination has a table giving  effectiveness (actual reduction of infection risk) between 10 - 60 % for different years.\nEven if the acquired immunity by vaccination is for the wrong strain, one may still benefit from cross-immunity(?) in that the disease will be milder and possibly shorter.\n\n\n\n* also acquired immunity after a disesase does not always last life-long, e.g. a pertussis infection will achieve immunity for 4 - 20 years only (4 - 12 years for vaccination)\n"

        "question": "I found the there is a project Folding@home to fight against COVID-19. As far as I understand, it uses huge amount of computing power to find a cure. Why do we need such a huge number of potential candidates for compounds? I have understood that the limiting thing when developing drugs is the clinical tests, and one research team can't do really many tests in a day. So why don't researchers just use a normal laptop and run some simulation program which says that next one should test the following candidates? Or have I understood wrongly how the distributed computing or super computers helps on medicine? It sound really weird if researchers has so accurate heuristics that simulations can say that this candidate looks more promising as that one.\n",
        "answer": "For the COVID-19 coronavirus, the first step of infection occurs in the lungs, when a protein on the surface of the virus binds to a receptor protein on a lung cell. This viral protein is called the spike protein (Wrapp, et al. 2020), and the receptor is known as ACE2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2).\n\nBefore proteins can do their work, they need to assemble themselves. This self-assembly is what is called \"folding\" and there are many, many different ways proteins can fold.\n\nAn antibody is a type of folded protein that can block the spike protein from binding to its receptor, therefore preventing the virus from infecting the lung cell.\n\n\n  Folding refers to the way human protein folds in the cells that make up your body. We rely on the proteins to keep us healthy and they assemble themselves by folding. But when they misfold, there can be serious consequences to a person’s health. (Source: Folding@home Homepage)\n\n\nYou asked\n\n\n  So why don't researchers just use a normal laptop and run some simulation program which says that next one should test the following candidates?\n\n\nTesting protein folding permutations takes a huge amount of computer power. Using the network of computers using the Folding@home app, they are combining the power of all the connected computers at once to work out the protein sequence as quickly as possible.\n\n\n  We can build computational models that accomplish this goal, but it takes a lot of computing power.\n  \n  This is where you come in!

        "answer": "I think the claim about viruses always being destructive isn't a good starting assumption for a question. For several reasons:\n\n\nIn the sense that OP is probably considering, it isn't true. Counterexample, see below (and there are also other uses we put viruses to).\nIn a wider sense, life is always destructive in that a living organism uses energy, substances, and space that otherwise could be used by another living organism. While we could debate whether viruses are alive or not, they certainly share these points.\nSo a bacteriophage (see below) may be destructive to the bacterium it infects. But that bacterium dying means the \"neighbor strain\" that is resistant against this phage is thriving. So one organism's destruction eases the life of other organisms.\nIn that sense, I consider the claim of desctructivity with \"so, what?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n  can we create a virus like a thing to work for good in our body\n\n\nHave a look at bacteriophages and phage therapy.\nBacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria, and there has been research about using them against bacterial infections about 100 years ago, in parallel to the development of antibiotics. \n\nBesides political/language difficulties (bacteriophage research was strong in the Soviet Union, and in consquence lots of the research publications are in Russian) back then antibiotics turned out to be easier and cheaper in practice (this may change with increasing antibiotic resistances, though).\n\nAntibiotics are produced by chemical synthesis or isolation from plant/fungi. They are chemical substances, so once we have studies that show that the stuff works as intended, product testing \"only\" needs to show that the correct modification of the correct substances is there in the correct concentration.  \n\nBut the viruses are more-or-less alive, and in any case they evolve. So chemical substance testing is not sufficient, for each batch the biological activity must be checked and proved anew. This means a lot of expensive work for each batch of the virus.\nAlso, the bacteriophages are pretty much the opposite of a broad-spectrum antibiotic: they are not only species specific but also strain specfic (I don't know whether that is the case always, often, or sufficiently often to hinder practical application). \n"

        "answer": "Well, I'm no epidemiologist and have neither the required data nor their simulation tools at hand. However:\n\nWhile testing is of course needed, I doubt that more testing can compensate for lack of distancing now. \n\nAlso, there is Japan with social distancing but low numbers of tests with slow curve, and South Korea does not only test but also practice social distancing.\nThere are also countries with lots of tests / inhabitant and heavy increases, Italy for example.\n\n\n\nHow are screening tests different from what is done now.\n\n(Slight disclaimer: I'm in Germany, so I know most details about the strategy here. AFAIK, it isn't that different in the US, though. At least, also here people are complaining that they get tests refused and people are talking that test capacities are not unlimited - but it's not clear to me whether people are sent home who should be tested according to a doctor ordering that test or only those who go/drive to the test centers because they think they should be tested.)\n\nWhat is done right now in most countries (including Italy, Germany, South Korea) is testing populations that are at a non-negligible risk of having contracted the virus. Looking at the current (Mar 19) numbers of positive tests among all tests (Germany) and using LR+ of better than 20  (below in parentheses)and expected 61 and LR- of better than 1/20 (below in parentheses), expected 1/61 (see long explanation here)\n\n            | pos tests/tests | PPV         | 1-NPV\n------------+-----------------+-------------+------------------\nUSA         |          11   % | 88 % (72 %) |  0.2  % (0.6  %) \nGermany     |           3.9 % |\nSouth Korea |           2.8 % | 64 % (36 %) |  0.05 % (0.01 %) \n\n\nPPV = probability of having SARS-CoV-2 after the test was positive\n1-NPV = probability of having SARS-CoV-2 after the test was negative  \n\n(There's the implicit assumption that everyone is tested with that same test - which is not true, the South Koreans by now may have better validation data, but I don't know this)\n\nScreening means testing the normal population, which (still) has much lower prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Assuming the dark number is 99 x the known case count (i.e. we have 100x as many infected as positive test results),\n\n            | 100*cases/inhabitants | PPV            | 1-NPV\n------------+-----------------------+----------------+------------------\nlow risk    | 1 in 10000 =   0.01 % | 0.6 % ( 0.2 %) | &lt;0.01 %\nUSA         |                0.36 % | 18  % ( 6.7 %) |  0.2  % (0.6  %) \nSouth Korea |                1.6  % | 50  % (25   %) |  0.05 % (0.01 %) \nGermany     |                2.0  % | 54    (28   %) |  0.03 % (0.1  %)\nGermany*    |                0.4  % | 20  % ( 7.4 %) | &lt;0.01 % (0.02 %) \n\n\nWith that assumed large dark numbers, Germany and South Korea would both have prevalences by now where using the existing test on the general population would start to make sense, as that would mean only 1 false positive case per true positive case. On the other hand, with prevalence in the single digit percent we'd be in the region where Frieden argues that testing of the general population doesn't make sense because it makes more sense to tell people to stay at home and away from contacts (which is the case for Germany - and since the numbers aren't growing as fast in South Korea, their dark number is probably much lower). \n\nIn the low risk population (where Frieden says testing would make sense), we'd have only correct 1 out of about 200 positive cases. The PPV is for many practical considerations too low: screening needs very good tests, with very high sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity, because it is crucial here not to overlook truly positive cases, and specificity because the true positives  are otherwise hidden in army of false positives. \n\nTo some extent, it is often possible to trade in some sensitivity for speificity and vice versa, e.g. with HIV test for blood donors, we do exactly this: we choose a very high sensitivity (so we can be sure not to infect anyone), and accept low specificity. So low, that a blood donor with positive HIV test isn't even told that they were tested positive. Instead, another test is applied (preferably by another manufacturer, because that adds more information than duplicate testing with the same kit), and if that is still positive, yet another one (a more elaborate one). After that IIRC it is still more probable that the blood donor does not have HIV, but they's be looking into it and taking anothe blood sample. \n(And the decision for the donated blood is anyways to throw it away just to be on the safe side). \n\nIn principle we could do the same for SARS-CoV-2. Chaining lab tests would mean an enormous burden to the health system of dealing with false positives (and possibly re-testing people) at a time where we don't have unlimited health resources and where the probability that the false positive anyways catches the virus next day or so is non-negligible. This makes this strategy that starts from testing low risk population a complete waste of ressources (even if we had unlimited capacity for testing). This may change in the future when we have tests where proper full validation has shown that they have very good specificity and a useful sensitivity.\n\nWhat we do currently, isn't very different though in principle:\nWe do currently chain two independent tests, just that the lab test comes 2nd: first a doctor comes and tests whether you are high risk group because you had contact with confirmed cases (maybe even 2nd order contacts) or you show symptoms. Then comes the lab test. \n\nNow the Germany* line in the table above is an interesting additional point. The prevalence there is from the influenza sentinel data from week 11 (last week). These are samples collected from people who were not sent to SARS-CoV-2 tests, but who went to a doctor with flu-like symptoms. 1 out of 251 was SARS-CoV-2 positive (and also influenza positive). The practically important point is: what did we miss because that SARS-CoV-2 case was overlooked (or would have been, had they not been in the sentinel sampling)? Actually, nothing: someone with the flu is told to stay at home and not infect anyone else pretty much like someone with SARS-CoV-2 (particularly now since it would also relieve the health system if the seasonal influenza would be overcome a bit faster). \n\nTesting in areas with few infections\n\nFrieden does not propose screening, though: he proposes testing people who have been in contact with infected ones. Which apparently did not work out in Seattle, from what I read due to a lack of tests - but it did work out in Germany where it allowed to completely stop the first (small) outbreak in January.\n\nHere, the \"had (2nd order) contact to infected person\" is the first test in the chain. This is a containment strategy, not a delay strategy. \n\nIn order for this to work, we need a two \"ingredients\": we must be able to trace the contacts (and better also 2nd order contacts), and people sent to quarantine must obey this quarantine. \n\nComparison Germany - South Korea (mainly)\n\n... the US is left as excercise to the informed reader\n\n\nSouth Korea apparently makes extensive use of autamated tracing of people in a fashion that would be completely unconstitutional in Germany.  \nSouth Korea does use social distancing: according to Wikipedia they also shut down kindergardens, schools, and universities postponed their semester start. It did not have quite the same impact on overall economy that we see in Germany now. Their shutdown apparently was not all over the country, but earlier: they did that when they had 1000 cases.  \nApparently the population did a whole lot of that volountarily: the wiki page says the streets of Daegu were empty on Feb 20 (when they had a total of 100 cases).\nIn contrast, Germany now has 15 k cases, and pretty much an official shutdown since the weekend in terms of kindergardens/schools/universities, pubs/clubs/... and apparently there is a sizeable sub-population that gives in to the urgent need of having their own big (!) parties since pubs are closed.\n(I can only speak from what I read in the news, I live in rural Germany where my sports clubs canceled everything - but the neighbors had a 4 generation party (not that many people, but...) for their new house yesterday. (OTOH, we have 8.5 confirmed cases per 100k inhabitants here, so even with that factor 100 for dark number, we're still below 1 % prevalence now) \nWhat seems to be similar: in South Korea young adults are the ones who spread the virus. Similar in Germany (more middle-aged initially [those who can afford to make skiing holidays in the Alps], now the Corona-Parties are a young adult thing)\nI believe East Asia is in general more on the alert than we were. MERS and SARS are cited as reasons, but of course overall high population density also means a permanently increased risk of infectious disesases.\nThe Wiki page about COVID-19 in South Korea indicates similar testing capacity for South Korea (10k tests/day; 51 mio inhabitants) and Germany (16k tests/day; 80 mio inhabitants)\n\n\nSome countries with more or less flat curves and more or less testing (per mio inhabitants):\n\n\nSouth Korea so far done about 6000 tests / mio inhabitants\nItaly 7300 / mio (maybe a bit late, but the main thing that was late in Italy is that for a while they didn't realize they had SARS-CoV-2)\nJapan only 117/mio - but they have a very slow growth, still less than 1000 cases and their curve is decidedly flattening. Japan distances socially since Feb 25th (incl. e.g. to stay at home and not go to a doctor with only mild cold-like symptoms) at 167 cases in the whole country.\nSingapore practices certain measures of social distancing since late January when they had &lt; 10 cases. (Didn't find testing numbers, though)\nNorway has 6440 tests/mio inhabitants. Hopeful look at curve suggests that a slight flattening may take place. They started their lockdown at ≈700 cases, a bit more than a week ago.\nGermany has ≈2100 tests/mio. 100 k tests were done in week 11, current capacity is about 30 k tests/day (is currently ramping up).\n(substantial flattening at the earliest expected in about 2 weeks)\nUSA: according to Wikipedia 300 / mio inhabitants, but the German newspaper cites 3.5x as many tests, that would be 1100 / mio inhabitants.\n(The difference may be whether private lab tests are counted or not?)\n\n\nThe Dutch test\n\n... is about antibodies whereas the other tests look for virus RNA. These tests again good for different things:\n\n\nThe Dutch test tells whether there has been sufficient exposure to the virus (and sufficient time thereafter) to build antibodies. (Once we know more about this, it may also tell whether one is immune against SARS-CoV-2)\nAs they say, this is also important for getting an idea about the dark numbers of people who have been infected, but had so mild symptoms they didn't realize it.\nThe other tests tell whether you currently have the virus (and are contagious). \nScreening for active cases needs this test - the more so as the antibody test may become positive only a while after one is already contagious. \n\n\nSimulitis\n\nThe Washington Post has simulations of the spread of a (easier, more basic) disease called simulitis with 4 scenarios, ranging from no measures at all over a not quite perfect quarantine to moderate and extensive social distancing (25 % and 10  % of the population run around as always, rest stays where they are). I highly recommend reading, but here are some runs I just did:\n\n\n\nBrown are active cases, violet cured/immune and blue susceptible persons.\n\nImportant findig for this question: in the first part of the quarantine simulation, the quarantine worked an noone got out (1st hump). Note that this hump has roughly the same height as the moderate social distancing hump, and leaky quarantine is worse (though the simulation doesn't get any newly infected into a new quarantine - I'd say the quarantine situation may be less like real quarantine and more like totally closed borders vs. not-quite-free movement between two countries). \n"

        "answer": "One of the primary purposes of corticosteroids is to suppress immune activity and inflammation: that's exactly why they are used in asthma.\n\nOf course the immune system has an actual job besides causing nuisance inflammation: fighting infection.\n\nFor some infections, the harm to the infected person caused by the immune reaction itself is worse than that of the pathogen itself, so steroids can help prevent damage or ease symptoms while the immune system continues to mount a response, without being hyperactive.\n\nFor others, immune suppression may be detrimental. \n\nCorticosteroids mediate the immune response by suppressing a variety of cytokines and increasing others, which influences activity circulating numbers of different immune cell populations. Cortisol binds the glucocorticoid receptor, causing numerous changes in gene expression, many of which are associated with the immune system. From Wikipedia:\n\n\n  (cortisol) inhibits production of interleukin (IL)-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma, IFN-alpha, and tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-alpha by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T helper (Th)1 cells, but upregulates IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 by Th2 cells. This results in a shift toward a Th2 immune response rather than general immunosuppression. The activation of the stress system (and resulting increase in cortisol and Th2 shift) seen during an infection is believed to be a protective mechanism which prevents an over-activation of the inflammatory response.\n\n\nIn other words, corticosteroids work by by suppressing the generalized killing/cleanup part of the immune system mediated by macrophages and CD8+ cells, while preserving the B-cell part of the immune system that produces specific antibodies and the neutrophils that phagocytose antibody- and complement-bound pathogens.\n\nImmune reactions are incredibly complex, so some of these basics may be violated in certain circumstances (including prolonged rather than acute dosing), and I've left out a lot of the other related immune cells.

        "answer": "Sorry this is a cut and paste answer from https://pharma.elsevier.com/pharma-rd/approaches-for-creating-a-covid-19-vaccine/\n\n\n  Before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, no one had ever heard of the causative agent 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2). There were no approved antivirals or vaccines for this virus or for any related coronaviruses (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus).\n  \n  Problems with COVID-19 vaccine development\n  \n  Developing vaccines from scratch—which is required for COVID-19—is typically not a good option for stopping an ongoing pandemic. The extensive time required to develop a safe and effective vaccine that can prevent future disease in vaccine recipients (average of approximately 10 years) [1] means that the public health threat will end long before a candidate vaccine is licensed.\n  \n  Vaccine development requires extensive planning regarding vaccine design, vaccine production and purification, preclinical testing in animals (to ensure some safety in humans), and multiple phases of clinical trials in humans (phase 1 for safety and phases 2 and 3 for efficacy). Companies taking the risk and proceeding with vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 (at least 13 companies as of March 7, 2020) [2] are banking on the virus continuously circulating, so they have a population to conduct phase 2 and 3 trials with. If the virus disappears from circulation in China—or the perceived risk the virus poses to human health substantially declines—before phase 2 trials end, vaccine development will probably end.\n  \n  Vaccine design approaches\n  \n  Vaccines that are safe and stimulate the right immune responses that confer protection from disease are challenging to design. There are a number of different strategies companies have used: live attenuated or inactivated viruses, virus-like particles or other protein-based approaches, viral vector–­based vaccines or nucleic acid–based vaccines. Of the potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the pipeline, four involve nonreplicating viruses or protein constructs, four have nucleic acid–based designs, two contain live attenuated viruses and one involves a viral vector [2]. Regarding the previous SARS pandemic, one inactivated SARS-CoV [3] and one DNA-based vaccine [4] made it through phase 1 trials before vaccine development ended.\n  \n  The different approaches for vaccine design all carry different advantages and disadvantages [5]. Approaches involving replicating viruses stimulate robust immune responses, but safety is often a concern. Protein vaccines and nucleic acid–based vaccines are often safer but typically have less immunogenicity, and they require adjustments to induce stronger immune responses. Nucleic acid–based vaccines are typically the fastest to get into phase 1 studies, but no nucleic acid vaccine has been licensed for use in humans as of yet.\n  \n  Because of safety concerns involving older populations (who have higher risk for severe disease), using a live attenuated virus might not be the best approach [6]. Patients with severe disease typically have T-helper 2 responses (immune responses typically induced against extracellular parasites), so vaccines known to elicit this type of immune response (inactivated viruses, virus vectors) might also be best avoided. Vaccines involving protein-based (virus protein subunits, virus-like particles, nanoparticles) or nucleic acid–based (DNA or RNA encoding virus structural proteins) designs, which do not have known safety disadvantages, might be the best approaches for SARS-CoV-2.\n  \n  Unfortunately, our knowledge of the immune response is not advanced enough for us to accurately predict vaccine safety and efficacy. What we have to do (testing multiple different strategies) is exactly what is being done. Only with results from more extensive research will we know the absolute best approaches for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. \n\n\nFurthermore experts have said that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is heavily glycosalated so that potential immune epitopes are hidden from the immune system.\n"

        "answer": "Update Apr 2: Pooled tests are under development now (newspaper in German), the plan is to pool 5 samples and to use the usual amount of each sample (and presumably dilute less) so that sensitivity is not an issue. \n\n\n\nIn general, pooled tests help in screening situations, that is, when very few samples are positive, so that 10+ samples can be pooled and still only a small fraction of pooled samples is positive. They require good sensitivity.  \n\nWe're not in a screening situation with the current SARS-CoV-2 testing, and pooling wouldn't help much right now - it would probably not be worth while the effort to develop and implment pooled tests. \n\n\n\nLong version:\n\n(update: deleted newspaper hints that logistics may be the bottleneck:)\n\n\n  What is the bottle neck in the testign process?\n\n\nAccording to Kekulé (10 min or so into the interview) the \"lab machinery\" in Germany has a capacity of several 100k tests per day, but right now there are shortages in reagents but also e.g. in the swabs for taking samples (so, comparably low tech parts of the test). Pooled tests of course need just as many swabs (if not more: false negatives due to the sampling not picking up virus material is a concern, and the usual remedy is to take more swabs.)\n\n\n\nAnything that comes now are my guesses as a professional from a neighbouring field: analytical chemistry). I don't have any first hand experience with PCR. \n\n\n  Does the amount of material needed to test for COVID-19 scale rather with the number of performed tests, or with the amount of tested material?\n\n\nI expect the reagent needs to scale (mostly) with the number of performed tests. I also expect the amount of tested material to be the same (prescribed by the method/protocol) for each run. That is, when you pool n samples, you'd take only 1/n of material from each (In practice it may be better to pool and then take out 1/n of the pooled sample).  Update: The test described in the newspaper goes the opposite direction: they take n times the sample material in order to avoid trouble with low sensitivity. In consequence, this cannot be considered a \"derived\" \"variety\" of the 1-sample tests, it must be newly developed almost from scratch.\n\n\n  Does the amount of time needed to test for COVID-19 scale rather with the number of performed tests, or with the amount of tested material?\n\n\nAgain: the tests, mor precisely the number of batches of tests since multiple tests can be processed in parallel. \n\n\n  Is the the nucleic acid amplification test still reliable enough, if the Virus RNA to be detected is dilluded among multiple samples?\n\n\n(From here on, we're back inside my professional experience)\n\nThis I cannot answer since I don't know the typical concentration range of virus RNA in the samples of positive cases.  \n\nThe lowest concentration of virus RNA that can reliably be detected is called the limit of detection (LoD). In this context, reliably is 19 out of 20 validation samples at that concentration according to the emergency/\"shortcut\" validation procedure of the FDA (I expect other parts of the world to have similar validation procedures right now). The rFDA has a page with tests that have this emergency approval](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations#covid19ivd), and the Manufacturer information lists the LoD. \n\nOne would relate the lower end of the typical concentration range to the LoD to calculate how many samples could be pooled without the test becoming unreliable. \nThe linked news article hints that this may actually be a limiting factor. The test under development avoids this problem by using more sample material.\n\n\n\nThere's another limitation to how many samples one can sensibly pool. The aim of the procedure is to save tests. Thus, we need to set up the pooling so that only a small proportion of pooled tests is positive and a large fraction of cases can be \"closed\" as negative. \n\nHere's the fraction of pooled samples that is positive depending on the prevalence = fraction of positive samples and the number of samples that are pooled n:\n\n  \n\nContours are every 10 %points. Dashed and dotted lines are the current fractions of positive samples for Germany and Italy.\n\nFrom that, we can calculate how many samples we need to run (for every positive pooled sample, additional n tests) and from that the fraction of tests we save compared to testing each sample separately:\n\n\n\nContours here are right to left: 0, 25 %, 50 % and 75 % \"savings\".\n\nSo, at the current testing situation in Germany, pooling 4 samples would allow to save almost 60 % of tests. In Italy, pooling 3 samples would save less than 15 % of tests.\n\nA pooled test would need its own validation and one would also do some additional development to get the required sensitivity (LoD) for the desired number of pooled samples, meaning more delay until pooled tests would be available. \n\nIn addition, pooled tests alongside the single tests that are anyways needed would mean additional logistic burden in the labs.  \n\nI don't think developing a pooled test would be worth while right now, the more so, as other measures would give similar or better relief:\n\nDoing only 1 test per household would save about 50 % since the average size of a household in Germany is 2 without the need of any new test development.\n\nThe same is true for further concentrating the tests on the vulnerable/high risk population. \n\nThus, pooled tests may help in the containment phase when they'd allow to test a larger number of possible contacts. \n\nUpdate: Getting back into containment phase is the aim of the current lockdown. \n\nWe'd still have high requirements for sensitivity and specificity. This means, pooled tests would have helped most right at the beginning of the epidemic - but they always mean additional R&amp;D and also additional validation needs to be done (and part of the validation work btw. must be done in every single lab that wants to use the test) since they need to be implemented in addition to the single sample method. This means, they'll always be available only after the single sample method is established.\n"

Even if it lowers the transmission probability by e.g. 5%, it might be a lot.

This is way more than what is happening \nwith Covid-19 now.

        "answer": "The big difference in Italy today is that many younger, otherwise healthier patients need critical care and more generally that patients need critical care for a long time. These patients are not necessarily dying after they get care, but the extent to which the surviving patients require ventilators and supplemental oxygen is nothing like a seasonal flu and is likely inflating the death rate substantially among those who could otherwise be treated.\n\nFrom NEJM: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005492\n\n\n  Contributing to the resource scarcity is the prolonged intubation many of these patients require as they recover from pneumonia — often 15 to 20 days of mechanical ventilation, with several hours spent in the prone position and then, typically, a very slow weaning. In the midst of the outbreak’s peak in northern Italy, as physicians struggled to wean patients off ventilators while others developed severe respiratory decompensation, hospitals had to lower the age cutoff — from 80 to 75 at one hospital, for instance.\n\n"

        "question": "Let's say 15 minutes after a person coughs or sneezes, where does the droplet go? Up in the air and down to the ground? Is it different inside a building?\n",
        "answer": "Data suggests droplets remain in the air up to 3 hours, and longer for droplet nuclei.  Where they go depends on the local temperatures, humidity and air flows.\n\n\n\nThe image shows a cough on the left and a sneeze on the right.  \n\n\n  Currently, the term droplet is often taken to refer to droplets >5 μm in diameter that fall rapidly to the ground under gravity, and therefore are transmitted only over a limited distance (e.g. ≤1 m). In contrast, the term droplet nuclei refers to droplets ≤5 μm in diameter that can remain suspended in air for significant periods of time, allowing them to be transmitted over distances >1 m (Stetzenbach, Buttner &amp; Cruz, 2004; Wong &amp; Leung, 2004). Other studies suggest slightly different definitions, with ranges for “large” droplets, “small” droplets and droplet nuclei being >60 μm in diameter, ≤60 μm in diameter and &lt;10 μm in diameter, respectively (Tang et al., 2006; Xie et al., 2007). The concept is that the naturally and artificially produced aerosols will contain a range of droplet sizes, whose motion will depend significantly on various environmental factors, such as gravity, the direction and strength of local airflows, temperature and relative humidity (which will affect both the size and mass of the droplet due to evaporation).\n\n\nOops, breathing and talking can produce droplets yet health authorities continue to claim that masks are not needed (to stop wearers from broadcasting droplets into the environment)\n\n\n  Humans can produce respiratory aerosols (droplets) by several means, including breathing, talking, coughing (Figure C.1, A), sneezing (Figure C.1, B) and even singing (Wong, 2003; Toth et al., 2004).\n\n\nWe are being told that the main droplets are the larger ones being emitted but talking for 5 mins can produce droplet nuclei the same as a cough\n\n\n  Published data have suggested that sneezing may produce as many as 40 000 droplets between 0.5–12 μm in diameter (Cole &amp; Cook, 1998; Tang et al., 2006) that may be expelled at speeds up to 100 m/s (Wells, 1955; Cole &amp; Cook, 1998), whereas coughing may produce up to 3000 droplet nuclei, about the same number as talking for five minutes (Cole &amp; Cook, 1998; Fitzgerald &amp; Haas, 2005; Tang et al., 2006). Despite the variety in size, large droplets comprise most of the total volume of expelled respiratory droplets. Further data on the behaviour of droplet dispersion in naturally generated aerosols are needed.\n\n\nSmall droplets fall to the ground where they dry up before they reach the ground but some become droplet nuclei on their way down which allows them to remain airborne\n\n\n  In the classic study of airborne transmission, Wells (1934) was able to identify the difference between disease transmission via large droplets and by airborne routes. Wells found that, under normal air conditions, droplets smaller than 100 μm in diameter would completely dry out before falling approximately 2 m to the ground. This finding allowed the establishment of the theory of droplets and droplet nuclei transmission depending on the size of the infected droplet. The Wells evaporation-falling curve of droplets (see Figure C.2) is important in understanding airborne transmission and transmission by large droplets. Wells' study also demonstrated that droplets could transform into droplet nuclei by evaporation.\n\n\nAnd what happens to droplet nuclei\n\n\n  Droplet nuclei floating on the air may be carried by the movement of air. Entrainment of air into neighbouring airspaces may occur during the most innocuous daily activities; for example, as a result of people walking, or the opening of a door between a room and the adjacent corridor or space (Hayden et al., 1998; Edge, Paterson &amp; Settles, 2005; Tang et al., 2005, 2006). In addition, the air temperature (and therefore air density) differences across an open doorway will also cause air exchange to occur between the two areas, providing a second mechanism to allow air into other areas (Tang et al., 2005, 2006) (see Figure C.3).\n\n\nwhich is why they use negative pressure rooms when doing a procedure that can form aerosols\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143281/\n"

        "question": "This is an exploratory question.\n\nIf a COVID-19 infected person (person is unaware that he is infected) milks the cow for couple of days, is there a possibility of him infecting the cow thereby infecting the milk?\n\nSimilarly, if a dog licks the face of COVID-19 infected person, is it possible that the virus may spread through its saliva to another person in the vicinity.\n",
        "answer": "\n\nCovid-19 is the result of a zoonotic outbreak from bats to an intermediate ( and unidentified host ) thence to humans.  It is thought that bats don't suffer the disease themselves as they carry low levels of virus but the intermediate host modifies the virus, and amplifies it so that it vastly increases the amount of virus that can shed into the environment infecting humans.  One possible scenario is that bat coronavirus combined with a fish coronavirus inside the intermediate host.  This is based on the observation that the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene shares a 39-base insertion with a type of soldierfish that swims in the South China Sea.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 infects humans via the ACE2 surface receptor, but this receptor is not only found in humans.  Other animals have similar but not exactly the same ACE2 receptors and several dogs and one cat have returned positive swabs for SARS-CoV-2.  The cat developed covid-19 symptoms.  The first dog died two days after being released back to its owner but that might have been from the stress of quarantine in a 17 year old Pomeranian.  Ferrets also have an ACE2 receptor which also binds strongly to the SARS virus so presumably are also at risk. Mice appear to be less at risk.\n\n\n  This is the first human-to-cat transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). About a week after its owner got sick with COVID-19, after returning from a trip to Northern Italy, the cat developed coronavirus symptoms: diarrhea, vomiting and respiratory issues, Steven Van Gucht, virologist and federal spokesperson for the coronavirus epidemic in Belgium, told Live Science.\n  \n  The owner sent samples of vomit and feces to Dr. Daniel Desmecht's lab at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Liège. Genetic tests showed high levels of SARS-CoV-2 in those samples, he said. \"The cat recovered after 9 days,\" Van Gucht said.\n\n\nThe Hong Kong Govt is now asking that pets of infected patients must now be quarantined for 14 days.\n\nThe CDC gives the following advice (which is out of date based on the above):\n\n\n  If you are sick with COVID-19 (either suspected or confirmed), you should restrict contact with pets and other animals, just like you would around other people. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. This can help ensure both you and your animals stay healthy.\n  \n  When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. Avoid contact with your pet including, petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with them. For more information visit: What to Do if You are Sick.\n\n\nWe don't have information on cows but presume that they may also be susceptible.\n\nEDIT: Experimental data suggests cats are more susceptible to the virus than dogs\n\n\n  The team, led by virologist Bu Zhigao, infected five domestic cats with SARS-CoV-2 through the nose. When two of the cats were euthanized six days later, the researchers found viral RNA, as well as infectious virus particles, in their upper respiratory tracts.\n  \n  The other three infected cats were put in cages next to three uninfected felines. The team later detected viral RNA in one of the non-infected cats, which suggests that they contracted the virus from the infected cats through respiratory droplets. All four cats also produced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in cats should be considered as part of efforts to eliminate COVID-19 in humans, the authors note in the preprint, which has not been peer reviewed.\n\n\nand\n\n\n  Dogs, however, were less susceptible to the virus. The researchers infected five young dogs and found that two excreted viral RNA in faeces, but none contained infectious virus.\n  \n  Similar investigations in pigs, chickens and ducks identified no viral RNA in animals deliberately infected with the virus, or those exposed to the infected animals\n\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-says-pets-of-coronavirus-patients-need-to-be-quarantined-11582888486\n\nhttps://www.livescience.com/cat-infected-covid-19-from-owner.html\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html\n\nhttps://blogs.plos.org/dnascience/2020/02/20/covid-19-vaccine-will-close-in-on-the-spikes/\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-0-387-33012-9_93.pdf\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00984-8\n"

        "question": "I would like to have a confusing part of medicine cleared up. My experience of medical intervention is as follows.\n\n\nAs pointed out in the answer to Does taking antibiotics make you immune to virus? antibiotics do not work on viruses.\nIf I go to a doctor when suffering from the common cold, I am told to ride it out and take paracetamol for aches and pains. That makes sense as the common cold is caused by a virus.\nIf visiting the doctor because a chest infection arises however, a course of antibiotics is often prescribed.\n\n\nHow does a doctor manage to determine that the chest infection is a bacterial infection rather than a viral infection from the common cold virus?\n\nIf the bacterial infection arose out of a common cold infection, why is it the bacterial infection occurred and not a viral infection?\n",
        "answer": "This is actually a pretty complicated question because viral infections can damage the lungs in a way that makes subsequent bacterial infections possible/likely and it's often these that are fatal. So if co-occurring both may need to be treated, with different medications, or the viral infection may be ignored sometimes. It basically depends on the severity of the pneumonia (which I'm guessing it's what you mean by \"chest infection\"). For some background on causes of pneumonia:\n\n\n  Pneumonia is an infection of the lung that causes the alveoli, or air sacs, to fill up with fluid or pus. [...]  If pneumonia does not resolve it can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and decreased pulmonary function.\n  \n  There are several viral infections that lead to pneumonia (16). Influenza A virus (IAV) primarily infects the lung epithelium, and can cause viral pneumonia. [...] There are also a variety of other viruses that can infect the lower respiratory tract and lead to pneumonia, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, human metapneumonia, and some adenoviruses (14, 18–22). Rhinoviruses and newly described coronaviruses also infect the respiratory tract and cause disease. [...]\n  \n  A variety of bacteria can also lead to the development of pneumonia. Bacterial pathogens as well as opportunistic infections (also known as pathobionts) can lead to pneumonia when allowed to infect the lower respiratory region. Bacteria that cause LRTIs naturally colonize the nasopharynx, but can cause disease when allowed to proliferate in the lower respiratory region (24–28). The most common examples of these are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Other bacteria are acquired from the environment, and often these bacteria have specific virulence factors that allow for the adaptation and infection of the lower respiratory tract (29). [...]\n  \n  The vast majority of research in infection biology has been devoted to studying the interactions of a single pathogen with a host. In addition to single infections causing pneumonia, a common complication following infection with respiratory viruses is bacterial pneumonia (9, 26, 39–56).Many clinical infections and presumably subclinical infections are often in fact coinfections, in that two (or more) pathogens simultaneously or in close temporal proximity infect a single host (9, 26, 39–59). These infections are termed secondary infection, superinfection, or coinfection. The simultaneous response of two pathogens can manifest in many ways and often results in increased morbidity and mortality. \n  \n  To determine the best treatment options for patients with complex viral/bacterial coinfections increased understanding of the interplay between pathogens and the interaction with the host is necessary. Several viruses and bacteria have been shown to interact to worsen clinical outcomes. It is now believed that most of the deaths associated with the 1918 influenza pandemic were caused by superinfection with bacteria (60, 61). IAV/S. pneumoniae coinfection is perhaps the most well-studied example of viral/bacterial coinfection of the lung (62). However, bacterial coinfection also complicates infection with other respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus, metapneumonovirus, RSV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and coronavirus (52, 63–66). Young children are especially vulnerable to bacterial complications following viral infection (44, 62, 67, 68).\n\n\nSo the NICE (i.e. UK) guidelines for diagnosing pneumonia say for example:\n\n\n  Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a lower respiratory tract infection most commonly caused by bacteria; however, viruses are thought to cause approximately 13% of cases in adults, and approximately 66% of cases in children and young people. The main bacterial pathogen causing CAP is Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Haemophilus influenzae; epidemics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae occur approximately every 4 years in the UK, and mainly affect children.\n  \n  Inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for respiratory tract infections is common in general practice. [...]\n\n\nSo if you are an adult suffering from pneumonia (the Covid-19 pandemic aside) chances are you more likely you have bacterial pneumonia.\n\n\n  NG120 also emphasises the importance of face-to-face clinical examination in patients with acute cough if prescription of an antibiotic is being considered. Clinicians should therefore avoid issuing antibiotics for cough without a face-to-face examination. If bacterial pneumonia is suspected, it is important to assess the clinical signs and to determine their severity. [...]\n  \n  An antibiotic should be offered within 4 hours of establishing a diagnosis of pneumonia, and a 5-day course is considered appropriate in all severity gradings.\n\n\nAlso worth quoting from those guidelines:\n\n\n  In practice, patients often return at the end of the antibiotic course due to concerns that symptoms have not resolved; however, in pneumonia, we should not expect symptom resolution at this stage. When issuing an antibiotic, it is important to explain to patients that their symptoms are highly unlikely to have resolved at the end of the course, but that the infection will have been adequately treated. It may be helpful to bear in mind that chest X-rays are not expected to return to normal for up to 6 weeks after pneumonia, reflecting the ongoing inflammatory rather than infective process.\n  \n  Sputum samples do not need to be routinely sent for patients with CAP treated in primary care. However, they can be useful if signs or symptoms have not improved as expected after antibiotic treatment, or in people who have previously had frequent courses of antibiotics, as this increases the likelihood of resistant organisms.\n\n\nBasically, unless the pneumonia is severe enough (to require hospitalization), you won't get a test to determine the agent that caused it, unless the first course antibiotic doesn't resolve it.\n\nI can tell you from general experience that the cause of pneumonia will get tested in severe cases in a hospital setting in almost any country. (There are probably some WHO guidelines for this, but I can't be bothered to search them now.)\n\nShort coda on Covid-19:\n\n\n  A study of 191 patients in two Wuhan hospitals showed that 50 percent of those who died tested positive for secondary infections compared to only one of the 137 survivors. In this situation, antibiotics form a crucial second line of defence. Many studies indicate that nearly all severe COVID-19 patients will receive antibiotics. \n\n"

        "question": "Presuming that we were able to find a person who was never exposed to any of the human seasonal coronaviruses (part of the viruses that cause the common cold), would the virus be just as deadly for that person as the SARS-CoV-2 currently circulating around the world? Or is SARS-CoV-2  uniquely dangerous?\n",
        "answer": "The seasonal coronaviruses attach exclusively to cells with a ciliated epithelium.  \n\n\n  Coronaviruses invade the respiratory tract via the nose. After an incubation period of about 3 days, they cause the symptoms of a common cold, including nasal obstruction, sneezing, runny nose, and occasionally cough (Figs. 60-1 and 60-2). The disease resolves in a few days, during which virus is shed in nasal secretions. There is some evidence that the respiratory coronaviruses can cause disease of the lower airways but it is unlikely that this is due to direct invasion. Other manifestations of disease such as multiple sclerosis have been attributed to these viruses but the evidence is not clear-cut.\n  \n  Studies in both organ cultures and human volunteers show that coronaviruses are extremely fastidious and grow only in differentiated respiratory epithelial cells. Infected cells become vacuolated, show damaged cilia, and may form syncytia. Cell damage triggers the production of inflammatory mediators, which increase nasal secretion and cause local inflammation and swelling. These responses in turn stimulate sneezing, obstruct the airway, and raise the temperature of the mucosa.\n\n\nSo, the mechanism of infection is such that they only attack the upper airways.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 is totally different.  It attaches to the ACE2 surface receptor which is found deep in aleolar pneumocytes.  Their damage causes loss of surfactant in the alveloi, the collapse of these air cells that perform oxygen exchange and subsequently ARDS.\n\nSo, seasonal coronaviruses give you a runny nose but don't kill.  SARS-Cov-2 collapses your air cells so you don't have any oxygen.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7782/\n"

        "answer": "At the very least, coffee (caffeine actually) can can have a complex interaction with pain medication. \n\nCaffeine can actually enhance the pain-relief effects of some medications, like aspirin, which is why it's included in some \"combo\" OTC painkillers in some countries. (But if you take these regularly and drink caffeinated drinks too, you may well exceed the daily RDA for caffeine, 400mg/day according to the FDA.)\n\nHowever:\n\n\n  Oddly enough, what makes caffeine effective in pain relief can also cause headaches.\n  \n  Since caffeine narrows the blood vessels that surround your brain, when you stop taking it they expand again, and that can cause pain.\n\n\nI've also heard that if you don't take any pain meds, coffee will usually enhance your feeling of pain, but I can't find any (reliable) sources to back this up, even though in some circles it is recommended you don't drink caffeinated drinks when you have some (painful) medical (or quasi-medical e.g. tattoo, piercing, laser hair removal) procedures scheduled. YMMV. (Actually a 2018 paper found that habitual coffee drinkers have decreased sensitivity to pain.)\n\nThere are probably more aspects to consider including rigors and diuresis/sweating, both of which are probably modulated by caffeine. \n\nWebMD says (in an MD-reviewed article):\n\n\n  These drinks won’t help you get over your cold or flu, and some could do more harm than good. [...]\n  \n  \n  Coffee. If you’re going to sip a hot drink, might as well get your daily dose of caffeine in it, right? Wrong. Try to stick with water and nutrient-rich soups.\n  \n\n\nBut rather disappointing they don't offer any reasons why coffee should be avoided in this case, except that it is inferior to \"nutrient-rich soups\". But this seems hardly a flu-specific argument, i.e. you can't expect your diet to be just coffee anyway.\n\nThe CDC flu [patient] guide makes a similar recommendation:\n\n\n  If the sick person is not eating well, encourage\n  them to drink liquids. Avoid alcohol or drinks\n  with caffeine in them such as colas, tea, and\n  coffee.\n\n\nWhile apparently no reason whatsoever for avoiding coffee is given in there, this is put under the \"Tips to prevent dehydration\" heading, so it's probably due to sweating/diuresis being enhanced by caffeine. This seems to be a really controversial topic, e.g. a Time mag article cites some experts saying otherwise, so it's probably better left for a separate question.\n\n\n  It’s true that caffeine is a mild diuretic, which means that it causes your kidneys to flush extra sodium and water from the body through urine. If you’re peeing frequently, and thus losing lots of liquid, it’s logical to think you could become dehydrated — but it actually doesn’t work that way, explains Dr. Daniel Vigil, an associate clinical professor of family medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles.\n  \n  “When you drink a cup of coffee or you drink a glass of iced tea, you are necessarily taking in a volume of fluid along with that dose of [caffeine],” Vigil says. Even though caffeine is a mild diuretic, Vigil says, you won’t lose more fluid through urine than you take in by drinking a caffeinated beverage. Your body is able to absorb as much fluid as it needs and expel the rest, he says.\n\n\nSome studies seem to back up this latter view, but they involve healthy individuals.\n"

        "question": "Knowing that the routes of transmissions are mainly (only?) eye, nose, mouth:\n\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/modes-of-transmission-of-virus-causing-covid-19-implications-for-ipc-precaution-recommendations\n\nwould it be possible to purposely catch it in a specific way so that it will only result in mild symptoms? Maybe even infecting other mucus areas inside the body (by let's say injection) where it cannot spread too much.\nIt can be useful in situations where the probability of catching the virus in the long run is very high. For example one may prefer to infect the eye and protect the other routes (if possible).\n\nIn the same line of thought, maybe infect and then being knowledgeable about the infection one can start the treatment even before the first symptoms or at the first symptoms and aim for later immunity.\n",
        "answer": "There is no known way to infect yourself with a \"safe\" dose of SARS-CoV-2.  The eyes are listed as a portal of infection which is why health workers wear eye protection (goggles, face shields ).\n\nOnce the virus infects human cells it starts to replicate creating more virus.  At some stage the immune system will ramp up and detect the virus but this takes time.  Even if you find a dose of the virus to infect yourself, how are you going to count a few hundred or a few thousand virus particles and make sure you don't exceed the infectious dose?  And that may depend also on host factors.\n\n\n  The average number of viral particles needed to establish an infection is known as the infectious dose. We don’t know what this is for covid-19 yet, but given how rapidly the disease is spreading, it is likely to be relatively low – in the region of a few hundred or thousand particles, says Willem van Schaik at the University of Birmingham, UK.\n\n\nRead more: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2238819-does-a-high-viral-load-or-infectious-dose-make-covid-19-worse/#ixzz6IUiniq2D\n"

        "answer": "Since it seems unlikely that these data are available already from the novel virus, I'll refer to other coronavirus strains associated with outbreaks, the SARS-CoV coronavirus associated with an outbreak in 2003 and MERS-CoV.\n\nIn reference to the stability of the virus outside the body for SARS-CoV, the WHO consensus document said:\n\n\n  Data from the Chinese University in Hong Kong indicated that SARS-CoV has\n  been isolated from stool on paper, a Formica surface and a plastered wall after 36 hours, on a plastic surface and stainless steel after 72 hours, and after 96 hours on a glass slide.\n  Hospital environmental samples from a number of sites, including walls and the ventilation\n  system, tested PCR positive in Canada.\n\n\nA later follow-up confirmed that SARS-CoV is viable possibly for days in the right conditions:\n\n\n  In the present study, we have demonstrated that SARS CoV can survive at least two weeks after drying at temperature and humidity conditions found in an air-conditioned environment. The virus is stable for 3 weeks at room temperature in a liquid environment1\n\n\n1Chan, K. H., Peiris, J. S., Lam, S. Y., Poon, L. L. M., Yuen, K. Y., &amp; Seto, W. H. (2011). The effects of temperature and relative humidity on the viability of the SARS coronavirus. Advances in virology, 2011.\n\nThis suggests that SARS-CoV was better at surviving in the environment than other related strains, especially in cool temperatures. However, there was still a substantial decrease in viral titre by 1 week.\n\nFor MERS-CoV,\n\n\n  MERS-CoV virus could still be recovered after 48 hours2\n\n\n...on plastic and steel surfaces, though not at 72 hours, at 20C. The virus degraded more quickly at higher temperatures.\n\n2Van Doremalen, N., Bushmaker, T., &amp; Munster, V. J. (2013). Stability of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) under different environmental conditions. Eurosurveillance, 18(38), 20590.\n\n\n\nAssuming the new 2019-nCoV virus is similar to these, there is a risk of environmental transmission particularly in high-exposure locations like hospitals. It seems far less likely to be a risk after multiple weeks, but there is still little known about the new strain.\n\nI was unable to find more than speculation about rates of actual infection due to exposure in these conditions, but that speculation is mostly focused on the health care setting and in particular on transmission in health care settings despite extensive precautions.\n\nIt's very difficult to connect culture viability to actual transmission risks, and not really ethical to swipe different concentrations of a coronavirus on the surfaces of a room and let people wander through to see how many get sick. Therefore, the best evidence for surface transmission of these viruses is when other methods of exposure can be mostly ruled out, and this is a very imperfect estimate.\n"

According to one theory, the virus has traces of HIV and is designed to attack the immune system. My question isn't related to the evidence, which is non-existent, supporting this theory but rather the science behind the claim.\n\nHIV can only spread via blood, semen, pre-seminal fluids, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. Is it even conceivable that an \"HIV like\" virus could spread through the air like coronavirus? The conspiracy theory isn't saying you will get full-blown AIDS but that coronavirus can \"attack the immune system\" (in a way mimicking HIV). I'm not a doctor, but on the surface, the claim that a virus could even somewhat operate like HIV and be airborne sounds absurd.\n\nSeveral scientists have already said there's no way coronavirus DNA was engineered, but I'm looking for another angle to attack this conspiracy theory.\n\n\"There's absolutely nothing in the genome sequence of this virus that indicates the virus was engineered,\" Richard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, told The Washington Post Sunday.\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-bioweapon-tom-cotton-conspiracy-theory-china-warfare-leak-2020-2\n",

I mistakenly believed that the virus' mortality rate was around the same as that of the flu, when in fact it's much higher.\n\n\n\nMy understanding is that the virus' mortality rate is around 2%, which is similar to the flu. It's less deadly than SARS.\n\nSo why are people so worried, and why are governments going to such extreme measures to prevent it from spreading? My guesses are:\n\n\nWe don't know enough about the long-term effects of the virus, so better safe than sorry\nThe economic and social disruption caused by robust measures (e.g., quarantining) costs less than letting a new disease become pandemic, even if it isn't particularly deadly\nMass hysteria fueled by the media and misinformation\nGovernments feeling like they have to appear responsive to popular concern lest they seem lazy\nThis virus affects more developed parts of the world, so it's more visible\nThe Chinese government's over-the-top, authoritarian, \"only in China\"-style measures have left everyone in such awe that they think, \"this must be really serious!\" (When in fact the government's real intention is perhaps to cover up how badly they botched their initial handling of the outbreak.)\n\n\nAs for one's chances of coming into contact with the virus, the total number of confirmed cases in the world as of writing is around 80k. Let's say that the true number is double that, or 160,000. That's still only ~1.5% of the population of Wuhan, the city where the initial outbreak occurred.

It would be great to hear an expert's take on this question!\n",
        "answer": "The danger posed to society from this disease doesn't come from the mortality rate, rather from the potential to make large fraction of the population ill. Unlike the flu virus, this virus is a new virus to which we have no immunity.\n\nAbout 10% of the infected people requires hospital treatment, which is a lot higher than in case of flu. The death rate of the order of 1% is achieved thanks to excellent hospital treatment. With a far larger fraction of the population infected with this virus compared to the flu and a far larger fraction of the infected people requiring hospital treatment compared to flu, the available hospital capacity to give everyone the treatment they need can be easily exhausted. The death rate due to the virus will then increase.\n\nAlso, people who need treatment for other reasons can then also fail to get prompt medical attention. People suffering a heart attack who would have survived under normal circumstances thanks to getting prompt medical attention, may now end up dying too. \n"

        "question": "I know that the WHO came up with the COVID-19 name, but I see big publisher (Springer) also using \"SARS-CoV-2\" seemingly to refer to the same thing. To be more technically correct, they say the  latter refers to the virus, rather than the disease:\n\n\n  SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus responsible for an outbreak of respiratory illness known as COVID-19.\n\n\nAnyway, who came up with the \"SARS-CoV-2\" name?\n",
        "answer": "Although the latter term is less publicized in the mass media, a WHO page basically calls it official too, although it was the ICTV that came up with it:\n\n\n  Viruses are named based on their genetic structure to facilitate the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines. Virologists and the wider scientific community do this work, so viruses are named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).\n  \n  Diseases are named to enable discussion on disease prevention, spread, transmissibility, severity and treatment. Human disease preparedness and response is WHO’s role, so diseases are officially named by WHO in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).\n  \n  ICTV announced “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)” as the name of the new virus on 11 February 2020.  This name was chosen because the virus is genetically related to the coronavirus responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003.  While related, the two viruses are different.   \n  \n  WHO announced “COVID-19” as the name of this new disease on 11 February 2020, following guidelines previously developed with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).\n  \n  WHO and ICTV were in communication about the naming of both the virus and the disease.\n\n\nSo yeah, the two names originate from different organizations (as far as I can tell the ICTV is not subordinated to the WHO in any way), but they apparently held some talks on the matter. Nonetheless, the WHO does seem a little displeased with including \"SARS\" in the virus name...\n\n\n  From a risk communications perspective, using the name SARS can have unintended consequences in terms of creating unnecessary fear for some populations, especially in Asia which was worst affected by the SARS outbreak in 2003. \n  \n  For that reason and others, WHO has begun referring to the virus as “the virus responsible for COVID-19” or “the COVID-19 virus” when communicating with the public.  Neither of these designations are intended as replacements for the official name of the virus as agreed by the ICTV.\n\n\nLikewise, some virologists were displeased with the WHO name. In the later published SARS-CoV-2 (naming) paper of ICTV's CSG (Coronaviridae Study Group) they do \"mend fences\" however, saying that:\n\n\n  By uncoupling the naming conventions used for coronaviruses and the diseases that some of them cause in humans and animals, we wish to support the WHO in its efforts to establish disease names in the most appropriate way. [...] The further advancement of naming conventions is also important because the ongoing discovery of new human and animal viruses by next-generation sequencing technologies can be expected to produce an increasing number of viruses that do not (easily) fit the virus–disease model that was widely used in the pre-genomic era [...]. Having now established different names for the causative virus (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease (COVID-19), the CSG hopes that this will raise awareness in both the general public and public health authorities regarding the difference between these two entities. The CSG promotes this clear distinction because it will help improve the outbreak management and also reduces the risk of confusing virus and disease, as has been the case over many years with SARS-CoV (the virus) and SARS (the disease).\n\n"

        "answer": "There are two general categories of tests typically used for identifying viral infections: those based on viral genetic material and those based on host immune response.\n\nThe CDC page on MERS-CoV testing (also a coronavirus, just not the one that causes COVID-19) is an informative resource to start with (bold added and reformatted by me):\n\n\n  Molecular tests are used to diagnose active infection (presence of MERS-CoV) in people who are thought to be infected with MERS-CoV based on their clinical symptoms and having links to places where MERS has been reported.\n  \n  Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays are molecular tests that can be used to detect viral RNA in clinical samples.\n  \n  Serology testing is used to detect previous infection (antibodies to MERS-CoV) in people who may have been exposed to the virus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body’s immune system to attack and kill viruses, bacteria, and other microbes during infection. The presence of antibodies to MERS-CoV indicates that a person had been previously infected with the virus and developed an immune response.\n\n\nFor some diseases, the primary type of test used is measuring immune reactivity; tuberculosis comes to mind.\n\nHowever, tests currently being used for 2019-nCoV are of the \"molecular\" type: RT-PCR assays detecting viral RNA. Viral RNA is only present during an active infection. These tests can be used both when a patient is showing symptoms, to identify the infection, and also to retest later to show that the infection has been cleared.\n"

Where does that number come from?\n\nThe basic mechanism is clear, and the magnitude is plausible: Let n be the average number of persons infected by one infected person. If n falls below 1, then the epidemy will run out. This will happen if an infected person mostly hits persons who are already immune.\n\nThe question is: Why just 60-70%, not 40-50 or 80-90%? Does it come from historic precedence? Or from some formula that takes into account the value of n (the value before saturation has set in)? What citation classics could serve as reference?\n",
        "answer": "Some Canadian experts said 35% to 70% will be infected:\n\n\n  According to a disease-transmission model developed by University of\n  Toronto researchers, the virus’ overall attack rate in Canada could\n  exceed 70 per cent. That number drops sharply, by about half, “if we\n  add modest control,” said epidemiologist Dr. David Fisman, one of the\n  model’s creators, but it will take “aggressive social distancing and\n  large scale quarantines” to reduce it further, he said.\n  \n  “That’s still a huge number of people ill, and critically ill people\n  are a large fraction in this disease,” Fisman said in an email. “I’m\n  not going to share more specific numbers because I think they will\n  scare people to no particular end.”\n\n\nIn reality no one knows. I can tell you if they contain the spread no more people will be infected. If they don't contain the spread more people will be infected. Steps like Italy took today where only essential work can occur and all business closed except transportation, grocery stores and pharmacies are a desperate attempt at containment that may be too late. That said given recent numbers it appears to have worked for China.\n\nThe German Chancellor is wasting her time and ours spewing off meaningless numbers that will only serve to scare citizens of the nation she is supposed to lead. Something better would be her plan to make the homeless self-isolate for 14 days at home if they come into contact with someone who was positive or preemptively positive.\n\nToday the WHO leader said if American governments (Federal, State, County, City, etc) do not act it could be \"many, many millions\" dead in the USA.

        "question": "If the world hadn't noticed that Covid-19 was significantly different from previous situations, and if it had treated it like any other flu outbreak, what would have happened?\n\nTypically an influenza outbreak of any kind results in nursing homes and other sensitive areas being closed to visitors and their taking extra precautions for internal cleanliness and hygiene.\n\nIf all the effort were put into protecting the most vulnerable and everyone else simply warned to be careful, the disease would spread among the general population but there would be very few serious cases.\n\nIn the short, medium, and long term, would the world be significantly better or worse than it will be with the current political actions?\n",

        "question": "I have heard several times now, from both people I personally know and from others who have posted their stories online that they do not qualify for COVID-19 testing.\n\nFrom the stories I have heard, to qualify you have to:\n1. Had contact with a known case of COVID-19\n2. Been to a country heavily infected with COVID-19\n3. Have symptoms that have progressed to the point where hospitalization is required\n\nWe now have a reported 1339 cases in the US with likely many more undiagnosed by medical professionals or the CDC.\n\nWhy, when we are in a state of pandemic and all countries scrambling to get a handle on the virus, are clinics, primary cares, and even hospitals not administering tests to those who exhibit symptoms unless one of these other criteria are met?\n\nWith an incubation period of 2-14 days, it is entirely possible to have contact with someone who has it and not know you got it from them.\n",
        "answer": "There's yet another reason: a test can provide only a certain amount of information gain. If the probability to have contracted Covid-19 before the test is too low, even though we know more after the test we may not be able to draw  practical conclusions that are any different from the recommendations without test. In other words, if the recommendation goes from \"stay at home and avoid contact to others\" to \"stay at home and avoid contact to others\" the test would be wasted.\n\nThe Covid-19 tests are not suitable for screening purposes (i.e. searching for infections among a population where infections are [still] very rare). They are to sort out who is infected and who isn't among high-risk populations where 1 in 10 (or more) are actually infected. \n\n\n\nYou may want to look at my longish answer to How accurate are coronavirus tests? for relevant background.\n\n\n\nE.g., with the newly emergency approved Roche test, we may say that a positive test result increases the odds of having Covid-19 by factor of somewhere around 30 - 100, a negative result decreases the odds by a factor of 1/50 - 1/17. \n\nIf you are in a risk group with a prevalence of 8 %, the pre-test odds of 8 : 92 \n\n\nincrease to (240 to 800) : 92 or a post-test probability of having Covid-19 of 70 to 90 % with a positive test result, and\ndecrease to 8 : (4600 to 1564), i.e. the post-test probability of having Covid-19 is somewhere around 0.5 to 0.2 %\n\n\nThese post-test probabilities allow practical conclusions: if you're negative, you're fine and can be let to meet the public, if you're positive you need to go to quarantine and/or treatment.  \n\n8 % prevalence is my guesstimate for those who are currently (Mar 15th) tested in the US (and incidentally, also in Germany).\n\nNow consider the overall US population. With currently 1629 cases and a population of 328 mio., we'd get pre-test odds of 1629 : 328 mio*. \n\nThe test results change this to \n\n\npositive result: (27700 to 162900) : 328 mio or a post-test probability of having Covid-19 of 0.008 to 0.005 %\nnegative result: we don't even need to calculate this, because the pre-test probability was only 0.0005 %, post-test probability is lower.\n\n\nEven if we assume that there's a dark number of yet unknown Covid-19 cases, say, a factor 20 over the known cases, the post-test probabiliy after a positive test is about 0.2 % to 1%. \n\nWhat would be the practical conclusion? Well, probably that the positive case should stay at home as much as possible  and avoid contacts. Certainly not that they can rely on acquiring immunity against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nEven for low risk groups who have flu-like symptoms but no known contact to Covid infected people (or other high-risk situations) the pre-test probability of having Covid is too low to allow the test to make a meaningful difference: after all, even if it is \"only a common flu\", they should stay at home, get well and not infect others meanwhile. \nWhile the pre-test probability is likely to increase (because more people get infected), in order to keep the health system/hospitals working the recommendation will probably not change: stay at home in self-quarantine as long as the symptoms are mild, so that the health system is not burdened by cases that get well on their own.\n\nWe may also say that were the whole US population to be tested in that situation, the 32500 true cases of Covid would be drowned in 3 - 10 mio. false positve cases.\n\n\n\n*328 mio - 1629 ≈ 328 mio\n"

        "question": "According to the World Health Organization's situation report for March 12th, the African region has only recorded 51 cases of the Covid-19 virus, and only one of these cases has been fatal. The disease has so far only been recorded in 9 of the 54 African countries, with only three of these countries reporting more than a couple of cases.\n\nGiven the wider spread of the disease in practically every other region, and that the African population is around 1.3 billion, this appears to be a clear anomaly.\n\nWhat reasons are there for this apparent inconsistency with expectations?\n",
        "answer": "Health care in many sub-Saharan African countries is extremely sparse. As an example, Sierra Leone has less than 250 doctors for the entire country.\nAs a result, it is likely that cases in that and similar countries are grossly under-reported.\n"

However, COVID-19 has infected around 130,000 people and growing, while SARS totalled just under 9000 people infected.\n\nWhy is COVID-19 spreading faster and wider than SARS? What other factors have let COVID-19 reach pandemic levels, while SARS was contained and eradicated? Could the R0 factor be higher than believed? Was it initially slower to be contained?\n\nFull disclosure, I'm not in medicine or a medical scientist. I'm a software developer and data scientist, and this has peaked my interested in the spread of infectious disease.\n",
        "answer": "The viruses are acting differently.  Sars2-ncov-19 virus is much more infectious with a much higher viral replication rate, and with people exhaling the virus in the pre-symptomatic phase whereas SARS this was not happening.  Once the infected individual becomes symptomatic their bodies are producing antibodies which helps shut down viral particle shedding though virus is still being transmitted by cough which aerolizes the virus at a further distance then just by exhalation.\n\n\n  The nine patients, who were admitted to the same Munich hospital, were studied because they had had close contact with an index case. Cell cultures and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were done on throat swabs and samples of sputum, stool, blood, and urine. Throat swabs showed very high viral shedding during the first week of symptoms.\n  \n  The findings contrasted starkly with those from the 2003 outbreak of SARS in terms of viral load. \"In SARS, it took 7 to 10 days after onset until peak RNA concentrations (of up to 5x105 copies per swab) were reached,\" the researchers wrote. \"In the present study, peak concentrations were reached before day 5, and were more than 1,000 times higher.\"\n\n\nbut the mean incubation period is 5 days.\n\nhttp://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses\n"

The hydrophobic tails of the free-floating soap molecules attempt to evade water; in the process, they wedge themselves into the lipid envelopes of certain microbes and viruses, prying them apart.\n  \n  “They act like crowbars and destabilize the whole system,” said Prof. Pall Thordarson, acting head of chemistry at the University of New South Wales.

        "answer": "First of all the disclaimer: I'm analytical chemist but not clinical chemist. That is, I professionally do things that are related/to some extent similar to test kit development, but not for medical use, and I've only been very remotely involved with microbiology-related testing. OTOH, I expect that pretty much everyone who works in this field is likely to work a lot these days and not to have any time to hang out on SX.\n\nSo this is all AFAIK, and I'm happy be corrected - and OP please take this with the appropriate caution against stuff written in the internet by random strangers.\n\n\nThe tests are developed in much haste, and undergo some emergency validation rather than the full validation procedure that is usually required. This naturally leads to some uncertainty about their performance, but we accept that in order to have tests available at all right now.\nSee e.g. what the FDA says about Covid tests  \nList with FDA Emergency Use Approved Covid tests. \nDifferent tests search for different parts of the virus RNA.\n(This is getting very far from my field, but is this the information you're looking for as what exctly is tested [by the CDC-developed test]?)\nViruses mutate, so a test that works well at some place at one time may not work as well somewhere else or a few weeks or months later. \nFor a test to work, \n\n\nsampling \npossibly transport\nextraction from the sample (difficulty varies e.g. between mouth swabs and sputum)\nthe test kit  \n\n\nmust all work well. E.g. if the sampling is not done properly because there's no properly trained staff available, nothing can be done further down the analytic process. I don't know why the Indonesian tests don't work, but it may be as \"simple\" as samples undergoing long transportation to a lab with the appropriate equipment so they spoil on the way.\nThe faulty tests in the US seem to have had a wrong reagent - and burocratic approval was needed for the labs to replace that by their own good reagents.\n(Usually, if a lab wants to use other than the prescribed/delivered reagent, they need to a lengthy validation of the procedure - the point here is to be allowed to avoid that as it would take too long)\n\n"

Without such an application, there (rather obviously) won't be an approval.  \n\n\n  Was the test evaluated by the FDA?\n\n\n\nThe clinical evaluation needs to be done by the manufacturer, not by the FDA. The FDA then evaluates the results submitted by the manufacturer with ther EUA application. \nThe test is not on the FDA page that lists approved tests.\nWe don't know why. E.g., whether they it did not pass the FDA EUA requirements (I'd think that unlikely) or the manufacturer never applied (which may be totally sensible for several reasons, e.g. if their manufacturing capactity is such that all the tests they produce are bought, say, in East Asia)\n\n\n\n  What rigors did FDA approval of the Roche COVID test meet? \n\n\n\nsee the FDA FAQ on getting EUA and requirements for using a test even before that EUA is in place on the general requirements and \nthe Roche test Manufacturer's instructions listing their validation results in particular.\nFDA explicitly says that they want the manufacturer to be in early contact with them. \n\n\n\n\nA few more thoughts:\n\n\nIt is not only the test kit that needs approval, the test kit gets approved for use with certain extraction equipment (manufacturer &amp; possibly model) and also the lab needs certain approval.\nIt may be that in East Asia different machines (other manufacturers) are used, so that the South Korean approval cannot be used for evaluating performance with the machinery predominantly used by US labs.\nThe first EUA for the CDC Covid test was granted by the FDA on Feb. 4th. I.e., one day before Seegene had their first test kit according to the CNN post and thus more than a week before the Seegene test got South Korean fast-track approval.  \nThat such a test with fast track validation may turn out not to be that great after all is a known risk which is accepted in the current situation in order to have tests available at all. We still would not expect faulty reagents in the test kit, though.   \nTheres nothing that unique about the South Korean  test manufacturer. There are other manufacturers and also ones that were apparently even earlier (sent out first [unapproved] tests on Jan 10th) than the South Koreans, see e.g. this new post about a Berlin manufacturer of such tests (in German). This news post reads very similar to the South Korean, just with a different company.\nWe also don't know yet how long/where which test will perform well as mutations of the virus will happen - and they may affect the performance of some tests but possibly not others. The Berlin test manufacturer discusses this in another newspaper article/interview.\nAFAIK, other test kits also don't require manual PCR - whether in some countries the testing is done manually because the local approved labs don't have automated extraction/PCR machinery in place is a totally different question. \n\n"

And that perhaps it's why people with cardiovascular disease and problems have the highest mortality?\n\nFrom my understanding, there would be potential cardiac and renal issues. Possibly the negative effects of inhibitors may be reduced or managed by IV infusion of angiotensin 1-7, or supporting drugs (I.e. a vasodilator) as ACE2 won't be able to work on converting angiotensin 2?\n\nTo anyone whom is working in this area specifically, what I am really asking is, is this a viable avenue to consider, as a management strategy to reduce spread of the virus in-vivo?\n\nThe infection route and effects make me wonder how many people that recover from COVID19 may unfortunately suffer later cardiological or renal issues due to damage in ACE2 expression within the lungs...

        "answer": "The problem appears to be that the SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to the ACE2 receptor and carries the receptor into the cell where the RNA of the virus is then released. Because the cell now lacks ACE2 surface receptors this leads to intracellular damage due to lack of inhibition of AT1-R in the Renin Angiotensin System.  \n\nThe cells that are damaged in the lung are deep alveolar cells that make surfactant and this collapses the alveoli causing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. interestingly lung infiltrates are seen early in the disease hence the use in China of CT chest scans for screening before rapid PCR became available. ACE2 are also found widely throughout the heart and gut the latter where it assists enzymes that are transporting amino acids.  The ACE2 receptor bearing cells are found in cardiac tissue, lung, gut, macrophages etc and the main clinical effect of their loss of function is to cause cardiopulmonary damage.\n\nif you were to create a drug that targeted the ACE2 receptor then you would be replicating the deleterious effect of the virus which inter alia blocks the protective effect of ACE2 on pulmonary and renal damage.\n\nThere's been some experimental work showing that a fully humanised soluble ACE2 receptor can bind to the virus and blocks entry into the ACE2 bearing cells. It works like a neutralising antibody to the virus. \n\nThis treatment is currently awaiting Chinese FDA approval for clinical trials.\n\nJosef Penninger \nhttps://youtu.be/jAW6VBWTiAA\n"

What are the percentages here?\n",
        "answer": "This situation has not been fully characterised yet and has not been reported in the cases as a significant presentation before.  But ENT UK has issued the following advisory and hopes to stall the inappropriate use of steroids for anosmia\n\n\n  There is already good evidence from South Korea, China and Italy that significant numbers of patients with proven COVID-19 infection have developed anosmia/hyposmia. In Germany it is reported that more than 2 in 3 confirmed cases have anosmia. In South Korea, where testing has been more widespread, 30% of patients testing positive have had anosmia as their major presenting symptom in otherwise mild cases. \n  \n  In addition, there have been a rapidly growing number of reports of a significant increase in the number of patients presenting with anosmia in the absence of other symptoms – this has been widely shared on medical discussion boards by surgeons from all regions managing a high incidence of cases. Iran has reported a sudden increase in cases of isolated anosmia, and many colleagues from the US, France and Northern Italy have the same experience. I have personally seen four patients this week, all under 40, and otherwise asymptomatic except for the recent onset of anosmia – I usually see roughly no more than one a month. I think these patients may be some of the hitherto hidden carriers that have facilitated the rapid spread of COVID-19. Unfortunately, these patients do not meet current criteria for testing or self-isolation.\n  \n  While there is a chance the apparent increase in incidence could merely reflect the attention COVID-19 has attracted in the media, and that such cases may be caused by typical rhinovirus and coronavirus strains, it could potentially be used as a screening tool to help identify otherwise asymptomatic patients, who could then be better instructed on self-isolation.\n  \n  Given the potential for COVID-19 to present with anosmia, and the reports that corticosteroid use may increase the severity of infection, we would advise against use of oral steroids in the treatment of new onset anosmia during the pandemic, particularly if it is unrelated to head trauma or nasal pathology (such as nasal polyps).\n  \n  There is potential that if any adult with anosmia but no other symptoms was asked to self-isolate for seven days, in addition to the current symptom criteria used to trigger quarantine, we might be able to reduce the number of otherwise asymptomatic individuals who continue to act as vectors, not realising the need to self-isolate. It will also be an important trigger for healthcare personnel to employ full PPE and help to counter the higher rates of infection found amongst ENT surgeons compared to other healthcare workers. \n\n\nhttps://www.entuk.org/loss-sense-smell-marker-covid-19-infection\n"

        "answer": "Bed bugs eat blood.  Red cells do not contain DNA which can be hijacked by the SARS-CoV-2 virus so the bugs should not have any viable virus unless the bug is covered with infected droplets of someone's cough.  That seems highly improbable.\n\n\n  Bed bugs are not known to spread disease. Bed bugs can be an annoyance because their presence may cause itching and loss of sleep. Sometimes the itching can lead to excessive scratching that can sometimes increase the chance of a secondary skin infection.\n\n\nand \n\n\n  A common concern with bed bugs is whether or not they transmit diseases. Although bed bugs can harbor various pathogens, transmission to humans has not been proven and is considered unlikely.\n\n\nHowever, blood also contains some macrophages which have been shown to possess ACE2 receptors which could lead to the macrophages getting infected though surface expression is low.  One would have to posit that the virus enters the bug's gut but somehow leaves again, and somehow reaches the bugs' beak while being unable to replicate.  \n\nTo further put this into perspective a cc of blood has usually less than 15,000 white cells. The volume of blood suckled by a bed bug is a way lot less, and macrophages are further sparse in white cells at 5%.\n\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.26.919985v1.full\n\nhttps://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef636\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/parasites/bedbugs/faqs.html\n"

        "question": "According to this article, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could be effective treatments for Covid-19.\n\n\n  Assuming the drugs are well tolerated in clinical trials and seem effective at treating COVID-19, the FDA will take measures to increase the nation's supply, according to Hahn.\n\n\nAssuming best case scenario, when could these drugs be made widely available to treat the disease? By \"when,\" I mean how long is it likely to take?\n",
        "answer": "Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.. chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (and possibly in concert with azithromycin) have been touted over the past few days as a possible treatment regimen.\n\nAnd there's some cause for that - the antiviral properties of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in vitro are broad and it's been trialed against various things (HIV, Ebola etc), however this hasn't always transferred particularly well into an actual treatment. And there's some research suggesting that it can successfully battle SARS-CoV-2 in vitro too. However, killing something in a petri dish is one thing, treating a disease in a human is another.\n\nThere has been some preliminary trials done - I believe there's been some fairly non-specific vagueness about it being promising when used in China and there's a relatively new study that's come from Gautret et al in France.\n\nThe Gautret et al paper looks promising - on the surface. It seems to suggest that treating people with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin looks great:\n\n\n\nUnfortunately though it's not that simple.. first up we aren't talking about a great number of people here. The entire study comprised 42 patients (16 of which were the control), which isn't a huge sample size. And any patients who were on the treatment who got worse were removed from the analysis:\n\n\n  Six hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were lost in follow-up during the survey because of early cessation of treatment. Reasons are as follows: three patients were transferred to intensive care unit, including one transferred on day2 post-inclusion who was PCR-positive on day1, one transferred on day3 post-inclusion who was PCR-positive on days1-2 and one transferred on day4 post-inclusion who was PCR- positive on day1 and day3; one patient died on day3 post inclusion and was PCR-negative on day2; one patient decided to leave the hospital on day3 post-inclusion and was PCR-negative on days1-2; finally, one patient stopped the treatment on day3 post-inclusion because of nausea and was PCR-positive on days1-2-3. \n\n\nSo the picture isn't quite as rosy as the graph makes it look. Some people on this treatment still got worse, one died.\n\nIt get's even shonkier (technical term) when you look at the large swathes of control patients who didn't have the PCR test done for viral loads:\n\n\n\nThey effectively only properly measured the viral loads for 4 of the 16 control patients, so trying to compare the groups is verging on meaningless.\n\nSo before we look at \"when\" they'll be widely available to treat SARS-CoV-2 I'd be more concerned with answering whether they should be used to treat it. Hydroxychloroquine is not exactly harmless - while less toxic to humans than chloroquine, it's not something to give lightly, it can have immunosuppressant effects, and in sufficient dosages can result in potentially lethal cardiotoxicity.\n\nIt may yet prove to be an effective treatment - and the WHO is trialing it (along with other potential treatments) as part of their mega-trial SOLIDARITY, but let's not get too excited just yet.\n"

        "question": "Current statistics on number of cases will always be a few days behind reality due to the time between infection and going to get tested, asymptomatic people, etc. But why not take a random sample of a few thousand people people, and test all of them to see how many of them have the virus? Would that not give us a picture of the proportion of people who have the virus?\n",
        "answer": "Italy has 60 million people and around 70 thousand (known) cases. That's barely more than 1 in 1000 prevalence. For most countries it's less than this. So, you'd need a huge sample for a good estimate. And those tests/resources are better deployed where suspected cases are, for the time being.\n\nAnd sensible or not, I've heard this from a colleague, and it's confirmed by the news that Romania's capital Bucharest plans to randomly test a sample of 10,500 people to determine the extent of the virus spread over there.\n\n\n  Manager of the “Matei Bals” Infectious Diseases Institute Adrian Streinu-Cercel has announced that a pilot project for testing 10,500 persons for the novel coronavirus will start in Bucharest within a scientific study to detect those infected with SARS CoV-2 virus, from the desire to thus prevent the severe forms of illness.\n  \n  Streinu-Cercel mentioned that, for a population of approximately 2 million inhabitants, the testing of 9,558 persons is necessary, with a correction of 10% being applied to this number. He also stated that the sample can be resized along the way. In this regard, Streinu-Cercel referred to the recommendations of the World Health Organization, which asked that testing be conducted to detect COVID 19. The manager of the “Matei Bals” Institute showed that it is necessary to test the medical staff and patients, but also the population, in order to know if “it’s healthy, if it is currently infected or went through the infection” with this virus, these three pieces of information completely changing how this pandemic is approached in the near future. [...]\n  \n  Streinu-Cercel underscored that, in lack of screening, the mild forms can go undetected, generating subsequent forms of severe infections. He also mentioned that the Minister of Health approved this project and stressed that this is a study with “scientific value,” not a simple testing. At the same time, he mentioned that in Bucharest there are 188 people diagnosed positively.\n\n\nNote that ~200 cases in 2M is 1:10,000.\n\nHa, ha, the more amusing part is that this turned out to be \"fake news!\" But it's actually informative to read the \"retraction/information\" as to why they are not actually doing such a study [obviously: insufficient testing capacity for the proposed sample.]\n\n\n  After the manager of the “Matei Bals” Institute for Infectious Diseases, Adrian Streinu-Cercel and Bucharest mayor Gabriela Firea had announced on Thursday that 10,514 people from 5 different age groups in Bucharest will be tested for the novel Coronavirus, PM Ludovic Orban reacted and said this is not possible.\n  \n  “We cannot establish the people to be tested randomly. Selecting 10,000 are just stories, there is a priority list for testing, it depends on how the situation and the testing capacity are developing,” the PM told a conference at the Health Ministry’s HQs.\n  \n  Orban said that the medical staff and those targeted by the epidemiological inquiries are qualifying for testing first, adding that “Romania has not been ready and the testing capacity has been limited”.\n  \n  The premier said that “the testing capacity in Romania will increase up to 2,000 next week” and will gradually rise, but to select 10,000 people “are just stories”, the more the death toll has been low in Romania.\n\n\nIn older news I see that India conducted a random test on 500 of their citizens. Rather predictably, they all came out negative.\n\nBy the way, if what you want to find out are the proportion of asymptomatic cases, there are some studies (albeit on fairly contained populations) that may have an answer to that, e.g. one on the Diamond Princess (the cruise ship quarantined off Japan):\n\n\n  [Overall:] Our estimated asymptomatic proportion is at 17.9% (95%CrI: 15.5–20.2%), which overlaps with a recently derived estimate of 33.3% (95% confidence interval: 8.3–58.3%) from data of Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan.\n  \n  [Caveat:] Considering that most of the passengers were 60 years and older, the nature of the age distribution may lead to underestimation if older individuals tend to experience more symptoms. \n\n\nFrom a 2nd study on the Diamond Princess, it's informative to read the testing strategy/order:\n\n\n  Overall 3,063 PCR tests were performed among [the 3,711] passengers and crew members. Testing started among the elderly passengers, descending by age.\n\n"

        "question": "I stumbled upon this boiled down news article which makes the statement that if we get the doubling time for coronavirus cases above the incubation period (5.8 days), we will be able to effectively \"flatten the curve\".\n\nCould someone explain to me the logic behind that statement? Can't wrap my head around it. Even if the doubling time  is 6 days, in theory (I realise the curve will naturally flatten as a result of population size and number of people already infected) you're still going to see an exponential increases in cases (i.e. 50000, 100000, 200000, 400000...)\n",
        "answer": "One of the issues with COVID-19 is the fact that it is transmissible even by people who are asymptomatic. You've probably heard about R0, which is the basic reproduction rate of a disease, that takes into account transmission modes and contact rate, among other things. I'm not an epidemiologist, but I'm operating under the assumption that someone who is obviously sick will infect relatively fewer people than someone who is asymptomatic, assuming similar contagiousness - the sick person should quarantine themself and clearly take measures to avoid spreading their sickness. A seemingly well individual, on the other hand, may not reduce their contact rate and unwittingly spread the disease. \n\nUnder this assumption, consider what happens when the incubation time is equal to the doubling rate. Suppose we have 1000 individuals who have the disease, but don't know it yet because they are still in the incubation period. 5.8 days later, there are now 2000 people with the disease, 1000 of which now feel sick, and 1000 of which still feel fine. Those 1000 sick people quarantine themselves, dramatically lowering their rate of infecting others, let's say to 0 for the sake of simplicity. 5.8 days later, the 1000 asymptomatic people now feel sick, after having infected another 1000 people, although the 1000 already-sick individuals haven't infected anyone else. At this rate, we have a linear increase in the number of cases, since old cases are quarantining themselves at the same rate new cases are spread - the number of people spreading the disease unwittingly remains constant!\n\nI've made several assumptions here, like that the transmission rate for asymptomatic individuals is higher than that of symptomatic individuals (although some symptoms, like cough, increase infectivity, and not all symptomatic individuals quarantine appropriately). I'm also not sure this is really an appropriate use of \"doubling time\" - strictly speaking, if 1000 people quarantine, and 1000 asymptomatic people infect 1000 others, it is not a doubling of cases. The statement also seems a bit of tautological red herring - if you are able to lengthen the doubling time, you have already flattened the curve, regardless of the incubation period. But I think the general idea is that a longer doubling time can lessen the impact of asympomatic, but contagious individuals spreading the disease.\n"

(Source.)\n\nPlease note: If you're sick, please don't use bike sharing. Please use your own car or bike. Or, better yet, please stay home. (Source.)\n\nHygiene\n\n\nAfter riding, wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. (Source.)\nIf you can't access soap or water, carry and use hand sanitizer instead.\n\n\nDisinfecting handlebars\n\nYou might have thought it unnecessary to disinfect handlebars, for three reasons.\n\n\nThe CDC writes: \"It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. But this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\"\nOn stainless steel, coronavirus particles can survive for two days, but virus titers start to plummet after just four hours. (Source.)\nUltraviolet (UV) light from the sun seems to destroy coronaviruses. (Source.)\n\n\nHowever, during the pandemic, various experts do recommend that you disinfect bike-share bike handlebars and brake levers. If a sick person used a bike right before you, they might have left their germs on the handlebars; disinfection can kill these germs. (Source.)\n\n70% rubbing alcohol solution is probably a good disinfectant to use here.\n\n\nAt home:\n\n\nDampen a clean rag, or some paper towels, with 70% rubbing alcohol solution.\nStore the result an air-tight bag, so that the alcohol doesn't evaporate.\n\nLater, at the bike-share station:\n\n\nDampen the handlebars and brake levers with the solution. Let them stay damp for at least 30 seconds.\n\n\n\nIn theory, alcohol probably shouldn't damage most rubber items. (Source.) But please see the comments on this post.\n\nDisinfecting wipes containing benzalkonium chloride (e.g. Lysol wipes) are another option. Benzalkonium chloride may promote antibiotic resistance and is toxic to fish. If you do use Lysol wipes, wash your hands after use and before eating.\n\nIf there are shortages of disinfecting wipes or rubbing alcohol in your city: Please consider leaving these items for sick people who truly need them. Instead, please avoid touching your face, and wash your hands after riding.\n\nExercise may strengthen the immune system\n\nThe research literature suggests that exercise, if done in moderation, probably strengthens the immune system. (Source.) During a pandemic, experts recommend against exercising in crowded spaces, or beyond the point of exhaustion, or when feeling flu-like symptoms. (Source.)\n\nSun exposure may protect against COVID-19\n\nWhen your skin is exposed to moderate amounts of sunlight, it may synthesize vitamin D. (Don't get sunburned; this increases your risk of skin cancer.) Getting enough vitamin D may reduce, but not eliminate, your risk of catching COVID-19. (Source: a MedCram video citing a BMJ meta-analysis. Please see also this BMJ press release and this post.) Regular outdoor exercise may help you to get more sun and to synthesize more vitamin D.\n\nThere are other ways to get vitamin D, such as from daily pills; but the details are beyond the scope of this post.\n\nNotes\n\nI'm not a doctor.

If that's not possible, then another person not known to be infected should move in with her, and the working relative moves out.\n\nIf the working relative is the main carer for the relative at home, and the above choices are not possible, then they have to manage the situation as though they already have the virus.\n\nThe recommendation is that you are not going to transmit the infection to someone who remains at a 6 foot distance away from you, and if inside that distance for less than 10-15 minutes.  So, that stops viral droplets from one person passing to the next.\n\nViral nuclear droplets form when aerosols develop, eg flushing the toilet, so the toilet lid needs to stay down when flushing, and keep windows open.  Even better still use different bathrooms, or build a composting toilet away from the bathroom shared with the other person.  If you're not able to not share bathrooms, then all the surfaces needs to be wiped down with .1% solution of bleach after each use of the bathroom, and left to dry for 10-30 minutes.  Each door knob needs to be disinfected. There can't be any shared eating utensils.  And most importantly the hands need to be washed for a minimum of 20 seconds using a soap/detergent.\n\nEven if people live together, studies in China showed that cross infection was not inevitable, but closer to 20% of households had transmission.\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection\n"

        "question": "\nWould symptoms differ from eating virus contaminated food versus breathing in virus?\nWould symptoms be a good indicator where the virus is located?\nThe COVID-19 causes respiratory symptoms and I guess that is because people are breathing in virus droplets in their lungs. But if you would swallow COVID-19 contaminated food and avoid breathing in the virus would that cause other symptoms like stomach pain or diarrhea?\n\n",
        "answer": "Well this is a guess because there is no published data that I am aware of in the english literature to be able to answer the question.\n\nA small percentage of people who have presented with covid-19 pneumonia have also had diarrhoea, it is thought that the faecal-oral route is also an important mode of transmission.  \n\nIf the person develops a respiratory infection the affected cells will eventually spill virus into the circulation, a condition called viraemia. This allows the virus to reach distant cells that bear the ACE2 surface receptor and these cells are also in the heart, kidneys and gut as well as monocytes.  One would also expect that intestinal cells affected primarily by ingestion of virus particles would also do the same, and produce a viraemia leading to the virus spreading to the lungs, heart and kidneys.  But they may present initially with diarrhoea before getting respiratory symptoms.\n"

        "question": "Reading numerous news articles about COVID-19, I got confused as to what is its main transmission route. In particular, I am confused as to whether it is\n\n\ndirect landing of respiratory droplets in mouths and noses, \ncontaminated surfaces,\naerosols (i.e., suspensions of the virus in the air rather than respiratory droplets quickly landing in mouths or noses or on surfaces), or\nsomething else.\n\n\nOn the one hand, the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that contaminated surfaces are not thought to be the main transmission route:\n\n\n  It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. (Link)\n\n\nThe same website appears to suggest that the main transmission route is  direct landing of respiratory droplets in mouths and noses:\n\n\n  The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.\n  \n  \n  Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).\n  Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\n  \n  \n  These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the World Health Organization (WHO), like many other agencies, puts the main emphasis on washing hands. Here is the WHO's first and foremost piece of advice on how to prevent getting infected with the virus: \n\n\n  Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. (Link)\n\n\nSocial distancing is mentioned on that webpage only as a second piece of advice, and, furthermore, the webpage implies that it is safe to approach coughing people as close as 1 meter away:\n\n\n  Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.\n\n\nFurthermore, I found an article saying that the virus wasn't detected in the air of hospital rooms with COVID-19 patients, but was detected on surfaces: \n\n\n  When researchers in Singapore tested the air in the rooms of three Covid-19 patients, they found no virus particles on cleaned surfaces or in the air even when they took samples on days the patients were symptomatic and presumably shedding virus into the air, they reported this month in the Journal of the American Medical Association. In the room of the third patient, who shed more virus, virus particles were present on ventilation fans and numerous surfaces — but all air samples were negative. (Link)\n\n\nBut the same article also says that Chinese researchers found COVID-19 aerosols near patients' toilets.\n\nMy question: Actually what is the main way COVID-19 spreads?\n",
        "answer": "The confusion exists because there are conflicting pronouncements from various authoritative sources but also conflicting pronouncements from the same authority.\n\nCovid-19 is a respiratory infection spread by droplets that can be aerosolized (nuclear droplets) in certain situations such as by flushing toilets or in certain medical procedures such as intubation. However, it reaches the air it contaminates surfaces and this allows for the infection to be caught through the eyes nose and mouth with the virus being transferred from the hand.\n\nThe data from Singapore and Taiwan show that handwashing and social distancing are successful in preventing disease transmission. However, if social distancing is not rigorously enforced then you will need to wear a mask. The head of the Chinese CDC, Dr George Gao, has recommended that everyone wear a mask which is advice that contradicts most countries health ministries. This is so that the infected are not shedding as many viral particles into the environment. His advice is based on the fact that there is a high degree of asymptomatic infection in the community and these people are spreading the virus by droplets just by talking and exhaling.  The contrary advice is because they feel users are wearing masks to protect themselves, and, in the absence of training, they are almost certainly less effective at providing protection.  But trained users have a similar degree of protection with both surgical masks and N95 masks.\n\nSo the main way of disease transmission is by respiratory droplet. But the fact that health workers, NYPD officers (currently over 500) and others are getting infected wearing masks points to surface contamination as the second main mode of infection, or, possibly lack of training in wearing the masks and/or poor hand washing, or, that aerosol transmission is indeed important.\n\nhttps://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/not-wearing-masks-protect-against-coronavirus-big-mistake-top-chinese-scientist-says#\n\nhttps://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/19/opinion/guidance-against-wearing-masks-coronavirus-is-wrong-you-should-cover-your-face/\n"

Both drugs appear to be protease inhibitors that are fairly specific to HIV, while SARS-CoV-2 isn't even in the same general group of viruses as HIV.\n",
        "answer": "The NEJM editorial that accompanied that issue says:\n\n\n  One antiviral-drug candidate is a combination of the HIV protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir. Lopinavir, which acts against the viral 3CL protease, has modest antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\nA quick search shows that SARS-CoV 3CL protease was the topic of some more in-depth investigations, including a theoretical Thai study of how of lopinavir might act on the 3CLpro of SARS:\n\n\n  it was found that a mixture of two HIV-1 proteinase inhibitors, lopinavir and ritonavir, exhibited some signs of effectiveness against the SARS virus. To understand the fine details of the molecular interactions between these proteinase inhibitors and the SARS virus via complexation, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the SARS-CoV 3CLpro free enzyme (free SARS) and its complexes with lopinavir (SARS–LPV) and ritonavir (SARS–RTV). The results show that flap closing was clearly observed when the inhibitors bind to the active site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. \n  \n  [From:] Nukoolkarn et al. \"Molecular dynamic simulations analysis of ritronavir and lopinavir as SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors\" J Theor Biol. \n\n\nIt's \"above my pay grade\" to comment whether that makes any sense or not as a practical approach to SARS (or Covid-19) medication, but the paper  notes that lopinavir has a similar effect on the HIV protease:\n\n\n  Similarly, this kind of flap (loop) closing was also observed when inhibitors bind in the active site of HIV-1 protease (Hornak et al., 2006a, Hornak et al., 2006b).\n\n\nAs noted on Protopedia\n\n\n  Drugs that inhibit HIV protease prevent the virus from replicating, and are crucial components of anti-HIV therapies.\n  \n  The proteolytic active site of HIV protease is covered by two \"flaps\". It is believed that these flaps must open to enable substrate polyprotein to enter the active site. Drugs that inhibit HIV protease tend to \"lock\" the flaps closed.\n\n\nSo I think they were/are hoping that 3CL plays a similarly vital role for SARS and Covid-19 virus replications, and so that drugs that close it will inhibit virus replication.\n\nThere seem to be other researchers who have considered this approach for the SARS-CoVs, so perhaps it has some merit:\n\n\n  One promising approach is to develop small molecule inhibitors of the essential major polyprotein processing protease 3Clpro. Here we report a complete description of the tetrapeptide substrate specificity of 3Clpro using fully degenerate peptide libraries consisting of all 160,000 possible naturally occurring tetrapeptides. \n\n\nThere's even a library-compound-search paper like that (i.e. trying to find molecules that would inhibit its 3CL) for SARS-CoV-2 out already (published March 26) by Chinese and Saudi researchers:\n\n\n  The viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) enzyme controls coronavirus replication and is essential for its life cycle. 3CLpro is a proven drug discovery target in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Recent studies revealed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of SARS-CoV. Therefore, herein, we analysed the 3CLpro sequence, constructed its 3D homology model, and screened it against a medicinal plant library containing 32,297 potential anti-viral phytochemicals/traditional Chinese medicinal compounds. Our analyses revealed that the top nine hits might serve as potential anti- SARS-CoV-2 lead molecules for further optimisation and drug development process to combat COVID-19.\n\n\nHowever, this latter paper also notes that there are some key differences between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 3CL proteases, so compounds that work against one might not be so effective against the other:\n\n\n  results revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro receptor-binding pocket conformation resembles that of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro binding pocket and raises the possibility that inhibitors intended for SARS-CoV 3CLpro may also inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.\n  \n  To test this hypothesis, we docked (R)-N-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-N-(2-(tert-butylamino)-2-oxo-1-(pyridin-3-yl)ethyl)furan-2-carboxamide), a potential noncovalent inhibitor of SARS-CoV 3CLpro named ML188 [35], with the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro homology model. We also docked ML188 with the SARS-CoV 3CLpro structure (PDB ID: 3M3V) as a reference, and ML188 bound strongly to the receptor binding site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The inhibitor targets the Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) along with the other residues, and the docking score (S = −12.27) was relatively high. However, surprisingly, ML188 did not show significant binding to the catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) of SARS-CoV-2, and the docking score (S = −8.31) was considerably lower (Fig. S3). \n\n\nThis paper also investigated (in the theoretical/computational sense) three other drugs of that kind that might work on the SARS-CoV-2 3CL: Nelfinavir, Prulifloxacin and Colistin. Nelfinavir is also a protease inhibitor used to treat HIV-1 and Wikipedia says it's also being investigated for COVID-19, but I haven't checked the details. Interestingly perhaps, lopinavir is not mentioned at all in this SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor screening study. I couldn't tell you exactly why, but it might be because there are at least six \"1st gen\" protease inhibitors used in HIV treatment (and some \"2nd gen\" ones) so they probably just picked one for this study as representative.\n"

        "question": "How quickly would boiling water kill coronavirus?\n\nThere are numerous articles telling us to disinfect groceries - wash all packages with soap and water and then disinfect with wipes, also wash produce.\n\nFor example: https://www.healthline.com/health-news/worried-about-contaminated-groceries-how-to-be-safe\n\n\"... wiping down all packaging with a disinfectant before putting your groceries away\"\n\n\"For fruits and vegetables, VanWingen suggests scrubbing them for at least 20 seconds with soap and water\"\n\nHowever, disinfecting wipes and disinfecting bleach as well as rubbing alcohol are all sold out and we may never see them again (until it is too late). And soap and water are not enough - plastic containers are covered with ridges and crevices (potentially filled with deadly droplets). Washing them all is impossible. \n\nBut many of us still have running water and electricity. So, it is trivial to boil a large pot of water and dip all packages and even produce in it. But is it effective? How long to dip? I guess there were no study yet about modern covid-19 but there must have been some studies about older coronaviruses. Does anybody know?\n",
        "answer": "The accepted knowledge is that boiling water for 1 minute kills viruses.  However, that is not necessary for SARS-CoV-2.  Any food you eat is going to be cooked for longer than a minute, and packaging can left for a couple of days for the virus to inactivate naturally.\n\n\n  The standard recommendation for boiling water is a FULL ROLLING BOIL for ONE MINUTE and COOL BEFORE USE. The term rolling boil facilitates communication and assures that an effective pasteurization temperature is reached to kill or inactivate waterborne pathogens. Some agencies recommend boiling for longer periods, but this extra time is not necessary and can cause unnecessary power demand and increase safety concerns.\n\n\nFor cardboard boxes:\n\n\n  On cardboard, no viable SARS-CoV-2 was measured after 24 hours\n\n\nAnd on plastics/stainless steel\n\n\n  SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard, and viable virus was detected up to 72 hours after application to these surfaces (Figure 1A), although the virus titer was greatly reduced (from 103.7 to 100.6 TCID50 per milliliter of medium after 72 hours on plastic and from 103.7 to 100.6 TCID50 per milliliter after 48 hours on stainless steel).\n\n\nSo, it can last for 72 hours at least though at greatly diminished amounts of viable virus.  So, use soap/water to wipe these surfaces down. Soap disrupts the virus capsule, and also forms a surfactant around the virus so it can be dislodged from surfaces.

The counterargument against these initiatives is that modern ventilators are complex and do, among other things, aspiration of liquid from the lungs because patients are intubated. Intubation itself requires sedation for long periods, which brings it's own problems.  \n\nWhy is such intubation necessary. Why not have a well-sealed mask? \n",
        "answer": "When patients have respiratory problems due to low oxygen saturation then you can supplement the O2 of room air by using high flow oxygen at various concentrations above room air using nasal cannulae or masks such as a Hudson mask.\n\nWhen they are unable to maintain adequate oxygenation levels with a mask, and/or suffering respiratory muscle fatigue, they are then placed on a mechanical ventilator.  The cuff on the intubation tube is to stop secretions falling back into the lung causing aspiration pneumonia as usually at this stage the patient is no longer able to protect their own airways. \n\nSome people have tried CPAP devices to supply air under pressure but that has the potential disadvantage of aerosolizing virus into the environment\n\n\n  While that measure could stretch the supply of ventilators and save lives, it has a major drawback. Officials and scientists have known for years that when used with a face mask, such alternative devices can possibly increase the spread of infectious disease by aerosolizing the virus, whether used in the hospital or at home.\n  \n  Indeed, that very scenario may have contributed to the spread of COVID-19 within a Washington state nursing home that became ground zero in the United States.

        "question": "It is well-known that South-Korea has developed a powerful system of drive-through testing allowing them to test hundreds of thousands of person in the past two months. I was wondering whether the test-subjects all visit those testing stations on a voluntary basis (because they are worried about their health) or whether true random samples of the population are being tested, supposedly requiring a government order to have certain people take a test on a (semi)compulsory basis.\n\nTo summarize: Is SK conducting random covid-19 tests on sizeable random samples of its population? Is any other country with a major outbreak doing such a thing?\n\nThis question arose in my mind in the light of rumours that the covid-19 epidemic would have a tendency to create a pool of infected 10 times larger than reported because alledgedly the main bulk of the infected don't experience grave symptoms and do not seek out a test or diagnosis. \n",
        "answer": "South Korea has adopted a highly technical and transparent approach to Covid-19.  By sharing where infected people have been, citizens can see if they have been in contact or near contact with the infected person, and then request a test.\n\n\n  Since the first cases were confirmed, Korean public health authorities and local governments collaborated to precisely document the movement of infected people down to the minute. Authorities sought testimony, watched closed-circuit television, investigated smartphone GPS data and more, publicizing the so-called moving histories of Covid-19 patients. All local governments share information through websites, text messages, and media. Companies have developed apps that allow users to visualize the information. Koreans can now learn where infected people went, when they were there, and how they got there. If someone learns they might have been exposed, they can quickly visit a doctor and begin self-quarantine if they have similar symptoms.\n  \n  On February 4, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took advantage of the post-MERS reform and authorized an unlicensed Covid-19 test; the government went on to test an extraordinary number of people. By February 26, Korea had tested 46,127 cases, while by that point, Japan had tested just 1,846 cases and the United States only 426. Tests still remain hard to come by in the United States, despite the Trump administration’s repeated suggestions that widespread testing is imminent.\n\n\nThere are few countries as technologically advanced as South Korea that are able to adopt this approach without a wide spread lockdown.  And it helped that they allowed the use of an unapproved tests whereas in the USA the CDC blocked the use of independent tests which has lead to their current deplorable state of testing.\n\n\n  Following the end of the MERS outbreak, South Korea enacted a new law in 2016 that allows laboratories to use unapproved in-vitro diagnostic kits in the case of a public health emergency.\n\n\nand\n\n\n  “Testing is absolutely critical with a fast-travelling virus like this,” says Kang. “We have tested over 350,000 cases so far – some patients are tested many times before they are released, so we can say they are fully cured.

        "answer": "There are about 8 common strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in circulation.  It appears to be mutating slowly based on phylogenetic analyses and each mutation appears to be the same in terms of clinical disease and lethality.\n\nSo, there is no expectation that if you catch the disease late in its spread that the clinical disease is going to be any different from any other time that it's caught.\n\n\n  Now, more diversity is emerging. Like all viruses, SARS-CoV-2 evolves over time through random mutations, only some of which are caught and corrected by the virus’s error correction machinery. Over the length of its 30,000-base-pair genome, SARS-CoV-2 accumulates an average of about one to two mutations per month, Rambaut says. “It’s about two to four times slower than the flu,” he says. Using these little changes, researchers can draw up phylogenetic trees, much like family trees. They can also make connections between different cases of COVID-19 and gauge whether there might be undetected spread of the virus.\n\n\nhttps://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/mutations-can-reveal-how-coronavirus-moves-they-re-easy-overinterpret\n"

        "question": "A previous thread on Bioinformatics StackExchange citing an article by the Economist which references a cartoon of predictive outcomes by the CDC (Economist article on coronavirus) suggests a model in epidemiology using the \"basic reproductive rate\", commonly known as R0. Although I'm no bioinformatician, I imagine that one could tweak a model based on similar infections like SARS and HDN1. Yet, I found no models predicting or giving confidence intervals for the spread of coronavirus. I wonder if the the data is still too sparse, e.g. we don't know if it's seasonal (mentioned in the above thread) and we cannot infer the virulence.\n\nWould such a model be reliable? If not, how many months of data would we need to reliably use a model predicting the spread?\n",
        "answer": "The original R0 calculation was developed in the early 1900s to model malaria transmission and is known as the Ross-MacDonald model so your idea is over 100 years old. The model was very famous for identifying the optimal strategy for malarial control by targeting the adult mosquito rather than the mosquito larvae. What it said was reducing the mosquito population and reducing malaria transmission were two different issues. So the bednet strategy is based in this idea and particularly spraying the inside of houses with insecticide.\n\nR0 was famously used in the 1980s to predict the HIV pandemic when WHO thought it would remain localised in Africa. \n\nThe problem with R0 and Coronaviruses is we don't know the asymptomatic population who could also transmit the virus. \n\nThis population is potentially very large. Epidemiologists will attempt extrapolation from cruise ship quarrentine, eg the Diamond Princess where everyone is tested to understand this transmission parameter and project this onto the rest of the planet. Clearly this could have limitations or inaccuracies. The other issue I am baffled by is seasonal transmission and whether this will occur with COVID-19. \n\nOne thing R0 of COVID-19 will identify is the latent period transmission which occurs before the symptoms, i.e. the incubation period. Essentially, people with cough/mild symptoms before they self isolate and become really ill with a lung infection will transmit the virus. In this context R0 will be/was very influential for understanding when to move between quarrentine and containment phases of the pandemic.\n"

And if it is, does it sound convincing to you as a proof that the virus developed in nature?\n\nThe second motivation given in the article is the following:\n\n\n  Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used\n\n\nAgain, do you think that this exclude the possibility of a human intervention in the creation of the virus?\n\nThank you for your opinions.\n\nEdit: I am a fan of Occam razor, I know that the scenario in which the virus originated in the wild is by far more likely than the human engineered scenario. I just want to know if, given our current knowledge in genetics, would have been possible for some high skilled researchers to engineered COVID19 (without implying that they did this with any bad purpose)?\n\nEdit 2: I share the concerns of the author of this post, that is, that the findings of the article are merely opinions and some of arguments are misleading. Anyone having a solid technical background can comment on this? China owns Nature magazine’s ass – Debunking “The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2” claiming COVID-19 definitely wasn’t from a lab\n",
        "answer": "In summary, the authors are saying the complete opposite of \"human intervention\".\n\n\n  While the analyses above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may bind human ACE2\n  with high affinity, computational analyses predict that the\n  interaction is not ideal and that the RBD sequence is different from\n  those shown in SARS-CoV to be optimal for receptor binding.\n\n\nThe interaction with ACE2 is taking place on the Spike protein (S) in both COVID-19 and SARS-Cov. The S protein is very different between COVID-19 and SARS both in terms of sequence and COVID-19 includes an additional furin cleavage site, meaning structurally it is quite distinct. The \"computational analysis predicts\" is difficult because there is no crystal structure for COVID-19 S protein therefore modelling ligand binding is essentially guess work, particularly as it comprises an additional (furin) cleaved domain. What the authors appear to conclude is that they cannot map ACE2-Spike binding of COVID-19 using an established SARS S protein structure. I assume they are homology modelling SARS-CoV onto COVID-19 S protein sequence data.  In my personal opinion there is no way to homology model an additional furin protease cleavage site (furin is a host protease) so it would be difficult for \"good fit\" to occur, but it is just my opinion and the authors may have established methods to overcome this notable limitation, e.g. similar phenomena occur in influenza. \n\n\n  Thus, the high-affinity binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to\n  human ACE2 is most likely the result of natural selection..\n\n\nTheir conclusion of \"natural selection\" is not strictly accurate and should be \"Darwinian positive selection\", but its a small issue. What they are saying is Darwinian adaptation has occurred as opposed to \"purifying selection, i.e. conservation. Thus they are definitely excluding human intervention because that is not \"natural selection\"\n\n\n  Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the\n  several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would\n  probably have been used\n\n\nThey appear to be saying that if a synthetic virus was constructed it would be created using an established reverse genetics system, and all those produced to date look nothing like COVID-19.\n\nThe phylogenetics argument is always a stronger argument than either of the above (although my opinion isn't entirely objective).  Phylogeneticists have had a long history in opposing conspiracy theories, e.g. polio vaccination, HIV and the list goes on, so it is much more natural territory. An example of such an argument is here which @terdon helpfully pointed out.\n"

        "answer": "Good observation! The 3' poly(A) tail is actually a very common feature of positive-strand RNA viruses, including coronaviruses and picornaviruses.\n\nFor coronaviruses in particular, we know that the poly(A) tail is required for replication, functioning in conjunction with the 3' untranslated region (UTR) as a cis-acting signal for negative strand synthesis and attachment to the ribosome during translation. Mutants lacking the poly(A) tail are severely compromised in replication. Jeannie Spagnolo and Brenda Hogue report:\n\n\n  The 3′ poly (A) tail plays an important, but as yet undefined role in Coronavirus genome replication. To further examine the requirement for the Coronavirus poly(A) tail, we created truncated poly(A) mutant defective interfering (DI) RNAs and observed the effects on replication. Bovine Coronavirus (BCV) and mouse hepatitis Coronavirus A59 (MHV-A59) DI RNAs with tails of 5 or 10 A residues were replicated, albeit at delayed kinetics as compared to DI RNAs with wild type tail lengths (>50 A residues). A BCV DI RNA lacking a poly(A) tail was unable to replicate; however, a MHV DI lacking a tail did replicate following multiple virus passages. Poly(A) tail extension/repair was concurrent with robust replication of the tail mutants. Binding of the host factor poly(A)- binding protein (PABP) appeared to correlate with the ability of DI RNAs to be replicated. Poly(A) tail mutants that were compromised for replication, or that were unable to replicate at all exhibited less in vitro PABP interaction. The data support the importance of the poly(A) tail in Coronavirus replication and further delineate the minimal requirements for viral genome propagation.\n  \n  Spagnolo J.F., Hogue B.G. (2001) Requirement of the Poly(A) Tail in Coronavirus Genome Replication. In: Lavi E., Weiss S.R., Hingley S.T. (eds) The Nidoviruses. Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology, vol 494. Springer, Boston, MA\n\n\nYu-Hui Peng et al. also report that the length of the poly(A) tail is regulated during infection:\n\n\n  Similar to eukaryotic mRNA, the positive-strand coronavirus genome of ~30 kilobases is 5’-capped and 3’-polyadenylated. It has been demonstrated that the length of the coronaviral poly(A) tail is not static but regulated during infection; however, little is known regarding the factors involved in coronaviral polyadenylation and its regulation. Here, we show that during infection, the level of coronavirus poly(A) tail lengthening depends on the initial length upon infection and that the minimum length to initiate lengthening may lie between 5 and 9 nucleotides. By mutagenesis analysis, it was found that (i) the hexamer AGUAAA and poly(A) tail are two important elements responsible for synthesis of the coronavirus poly(A) tail and may function in concert to accomplish polyadenylation and (ii) the function of the hexamer AGUAAA in coronaviral polyadenylation is position dependent. Based on these findings, we propose a process for how the coronaviral poly(A) tail is synthesized and undergoes variation. Our results provide the first genetic evidence to gain insight into coronaviral polyadenylation.\n  \n  Peng Y-H, Lin C-H, Lin C-N, Lo C-Y, Tsai T-L, Wu H-Y (2016) Characterization of the Role of Hexamer AGUAAA and Poly(A) Tail in Coronavirus Polyadenylation. PLoS ONE 11(10): e0165077\n\n\nThis builds upon prior work by Hung-Yi Wu et al, which showed that the coronaviral 3' poly(A) tail is approximately 65 nucleotides in length in both genomic and sgmRNAs at peak viral RNA synthesis, and also observed that the precise length varied throughout infection. Most interestingly, they report:\n\n\n  Functional analyses of poly(A) tail length on specific viral RNA species, furthermore, revealed that translation, in vivo, of RNAs with the longer poly(A) tail was enhanced over those with the shorter poly(A). Although the mechanisms by which the tail lengths vary is unknown, experimental results together suggest that the length of the poly(A) and poly(U) tails is regulated. One potential function of regulated poly(A) tail length might be that for the coronavirus genome a longer poly(A) favors translation. The regulation of coronavirus translation by poly(A) tail length resembles that during embryonal development suggesting there may be mechanistic parallels.\n  \n  Wu HY, Ke TY, Liao WY, Chang NY. Regulation of coronaviral poly(A) tail length during infection. PLoS One. 2013;8(7):e70548. Published 2013 Jul 29. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0070548\n\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that poly(A) tails at the 3' end of RNA are not an unusual feature of viruses. Eukaryotic mRNA almost always contains poly(A) tails, which are added post-transcriptionally in a process known as polyadenylation. It should not therefore be surprising that positive-strand RNA viruses would have poly(A) tails as well. In eukaryotic mRNA, the central sequence motif for identifying a polyadenylation region is AAUAAA, identified way back in the 1970s, with more recent research confirming its ubiquity. Proudfoot 2011 is a nice review article on poly(A) signals in eukaryotic mRNA.\n"

It seems to show that the current corona virus split from a virus in bats. And that the same ancestral virus is also ancestral to several other viruses, some in humans and some in bats. \n\nIs my understanding basically correct?\n",
        "answer": "Overview\nThe central focus of the tree is to highlight the key biological concern of the new coronavirus, 2019-nCov. The key concern is the genetic similarities to SARS epidemic, and relates to the SARS receptor. \n\nSARS background SARS is endemic in bats (your BioRxiv tree partly shows that and this tree definitely shows it) and in the 2002 epidemic infected civet cats which then infected humans. More importantly it is then transmitted from one human to another. This is a consequence of the SARS receptor been able to exploit the cellular receptors in the respiratory tract of bats, civet cats and humans and use this tissue as a site of replication. The concern is exacerbated because the tree here shows SARS independently infected humans on two separate occasions, suggesting the cross-over has an underlying genetic basis, which is part of the \"SARS lineage\".\n\nBioRxiv 2019-nCov tree Your tree shows the 2019-nCov has a recent common ancestor with SARS in comparison to the rest of the betacoronaviruses. This therefore provides some circumstantial evidence the receptor mechanism and ability to frequently crossover from bats and ultimately transmit human to human could be shared with SARS. At an evolutionary level (which is what ANY tree is supposed to reconstruct) it raises the question which common ancestor of SARS did the \"SARS receptor\" originate. I'd need to draw a diagram to better demonstrate this point, but I hope you get the idea.\n\nThe \"influenza receptor\" The analogy is with influenza virus and the entire epidemiology of influenza hinges around is sialic acid receptor of influenza and its ability to bind on to the cellular receptors in the upper/lower respiratory tract of birds, pigs and humans. The hypothesised mechanism is called the mixing vessel theory and is the classic epidemiological understanding of how new pathogenic influenza pandemics occur. If you replace \"birds and pigs\" with e.g. \"bats, civet cats and humans\" you get the idea why this could be scary. We don't the intemediate host of 2019-nCov ... but I speculate there must be one, unless eating Cov-infected bats is common in China.\n\nTechnical details of the BioRxiv tree The tree is a nicely diverse selection of the beta-coronaviruses. The authors have rooted the tree using the outgroups of delacoronaviruses and gammacoronaviruses, so it is a good robust selection of outgroups which can be used to correctly identify the direct of evolution of betacoronavirus divergence. In tree theory (its formal name is phylogenetics theory), extensive rooting is good and minimises artefacts.\n\nOne of the earliest members of the betacoronaviruses to diverge is MERS (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome), which form a single \"clade\" (all viruses share a unique common ancestor) and these represent around 50% amino acid divergence from SARS/2019-nCov. The selection of MERS in the tree from both camels and humans looks good. The selection of other betacoronaviruses looks great, I wasn't aware of the \"ruminant clade\"  at all involving buffalo, cow etc .. infections and there was an associated human infection. There are loads of bat isolates of the betacoronaviruses throughout the tree, but we eventually arrive at the \"SARS clade\". The authors show that 2019-nCov is an outgroup to the SARS clade and shows a close relationship to one (BioRxiv tree) or two (this tree) bat isolates. Looking at the precise SARS clade (better shown in this tree) we can see loads of bat virus associating with SARS lineages. We therefore assume the reservoir to SARS and likely 2019-nCov is bat, moreover that the single ancestor to both viruses was a bat (it is called a parsimonious hypothesis). \n\nThe one thing the BioRXiv tree omits, for example with regards this tree, is the diversity of SARS and in particularly the two independent origins of SARS, which is a weakness of their analysis, particular if this fed into downstream analysis. It is not to say the authors were wrong, but it was uncool. \n\nWord of caution my understanding is the divergence between SARS and 2010-nCov is around 15% and this is a quite a large amount of genetic divergence, even if both viruses share a most recent common-ancestor, form part of the same clade and receptor peptide motifs. Nevertheless there is sufficient amino acid divergence to generate notable differences in epidemiology, clinical symptom and transmission. \n\nMERS, SARS and 2019-nCov mortality rates It is worth noting that within the betacoronaviruses the mortality rates between difference clinically important viruses is very different. MERS has a mortality rate of 40-60%, SARS is around 10% but 2019-nCov is &lt;2.5%. The 2019-nCov mortality rate is still important given it has infected more and could potentially infect alot more people than SARS.\n"

Importantly, amino acid residues in all the 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-1 Gag. Interestingly, despite the inserts being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence, 3D-modelling of the 2019-nCoV suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site. The finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV, all of which have identity/similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature.\n\n\nSource: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871v1\n\n\n\nI know this is a preprint paper and it's not yet peer reviewed, but can someone tell me what the implications are if this is true?

        "question": "I have heard several conspiracy theories regarding the origin of the new coronavirus, 2019-nCov. For example that the virus and/or SARS were produced in a laboratory or were some variant of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), shipped via laboratory workers. \n\nI am well aware bioinformatics has debunked many conspiracy theories involving infectious diseases, an important one being polio vaccination programs in Africa were the origin of HIV, for example here. Likewise, numerous conspiracy theories on the man-made origins of HIV were similarly overturned using bioinformatic studies.\n\nDo you have bioinformatics evidence that would debunk the current conspiracists about coronaviruses?\n",
        "answer": "The scenarios are impossible and would be laughable if they were not so serious. The evidence is in the phylogenetic trees. Its a bit like a crime scene when the forensics team investigate. We've done enough crime-scenes often going to the site, collecting the pathogen, sequencing and then analysis - (usually neglected diseases) without any associated conspiracy theories. \n\nThe key technical issue is coronaviruses are zoonoses , pathogens spread to humans from animal reservoirs and phylogenetic tree really helps understand the  how the virus is transmitted.\n\nTrees \n\n\nThe key thing about all the trees are bats. Bats lineages are present at every single point of the betacoronavirus phylogeny (tree), both as paraphyletic and monophyletic lineages, one example is this tree of betacoronaviruses here. Meaning the nodes connecting the branches of the tree to the \"master-branch\", represent common ancestors and these were almost certainly bat-borne cornaviruses. This is especially true for SARS and - here bat-viruses are EVERYWHERE. \nThe tree here also shows that SARS arose on independently on two occassions, again surrounded by bat lineages and 2019-nCov has emerged separately at least once, again associated with bats. \nFinally the tree below is a figure from BioRxiv Zhou et al (2020) \"Discovery of a novel coronavirus associated with the recent pneumonia outbreak in humans and its potential bat origin\" shows the 2019-nCov lineage is a direct descendent of a very closely virus isolated from a bat (RaTG13*). This is a really conclusive finding BTW.\n\n\n\nNote, I don't normally present inline images, but it is such a nice finding (hint to reviewers) and BioRxiv is open access.\n\nConspiracy theory 1: laboratory made virus\n\nLiterally it would require someone passaging a new virus, with unknown human pathogenicity, and independently introducing all the earlier passages enmass across bat populations of China. They would then hope each lineage becomes an indepedent virus population before, then introducing the virus to humans. Thus when field teams of scientists go around using mist nets to trap the bats, buy them from markets, isolate the virus and sequence it they would find a beautiful, array of natural variation in the bat populations leading up to the human epidemics, that perfectly matches vast numbers of other viral zoonoses. Moreover, this would have to have happen substancially prior to SARS and 2019-nCov, because the bat betacoronaviruses have been known about prior both epidemics, viz. its simply not feasible.\n\nBiological explanation\nGeneral Bats are a reservoir host to vast numbers of pathogens, particularly viruses, including many alphaviruses, flaviviruses, rabies virus and beleived to be important in ebolavirus (I don't know about this) and even important to several eukaryotic parasites. It makes sense, they are mammals, so evolutionary much closer to us than birds for example, with large dispersal potential and roost in 'overcrowded' areas enable rapid transmission between bats.\n\nTechnical\nThe trees show bats are the common ancestor of betacoronaviruses in particular for the lineage leading into the emergence of 2019-nCov and SARS, this is seen in this tree, this one and the tree above. The obvious explanation is the virus circulates endemically in bats and has jumped into humans. For SARS the intermediate host, or possible \"vector\" was civet cats. \n\nThe theory and the observations fit into a seamless biological answer.\n\nConspiracy theory 2: Middle Eastern connection\n\nI heard a very weird conspiracy theory attempting to connect MERS with 2019-nCov. The theory was elaborate and I don't think it is productive to describe here.\n\nBiological explanation\nAll the trees of betacoronaviruses show MERS was one of the earliest viruses to diverge and is very distant from 2019-nCov, to the extent the theory is completely implausible. The homology between these viruses is 50%, so its either MERS or 2019-nCov. Its more extreme than mixing up yellow fever virus (mortality 40-80%) with West Nile virus (mortality &lt;&lt;0.1%), the two viruses are completely different at every level.\n\nWhat about errors? Phylogeneticists can spot it a mile off. There are tell-tale phylogenetic signatures we pick up, but also we do this to assess 'rare' genetic phenomina. There is nothing 'rare' about the coronaviruses. The only anomaly is variation in the poly-A tail and that is the natural variation from in vitro time-series experiments. Basically we've looked at enough virses/parasites through trees, that have no conspiracy theories at all (often neglected diseases), and understand how natural variation operates - so a phylogenecist can shift the wheat from the chaff without really thinking about it.\n\nOpinion\nThe conspiracy theories are deeply misplaced, and the only connection I can imagine is its China. However, the Chinese have loads of viruses, influenza in particular which causes major pandemics, but that is a consequence of their natural ecology (small-holder farming) allowing the virus to move between reservoir hosts. I've not visited small-hold farms in China, but I have in other parts of the world and when you see them, you get it. The pigs, chickens (ducks .. China), dogs, horses and humans all living within 10 meters of each other. \n\nConclusion\nShipping large numbers of bats to market, bat soup, raw meat from arboreal (tree-living) mammals such as civets that are sympatric to bats. Then consider the classical epidemiology in light of the phylogenetic data, which is very consistent, a single picture emerges that coronavirus is one of many zoonoses which has managed to transmit between patients. \n\nSummary The fundamental point is the bioinformatics fit into the classical epidemiology of a zoonose.\n\n*, Note The bat coronavirus RaTG13 predates the 2019-nCov outbreak by 7 years. It is not even clear whether the virus has been isolated, i.e. could just be a RNA sequence.\n\n\"They have found some 500 novel coronaviruses, about 50 of which fall relatively close to the SARS virus on the family tree, including RaTG13—it was fished out of a bat fecal sample they collected in 2013 from a cave in Moglang in Yunnan province.\"\n\nCohen, \"Mining coronavirus genomes for clues to the outbreak’s origins\" Feb, 2020 Science Magazine,\n"

        "question": "When calculating how lethal a virus outbreak is, I've noticed that most sources use \n\nCONFIRMED_DEATHS/CONFIRMED_INFECTIONS\n\n\nHowever, given that there are only 2 possible outcomes; death or recovery, wouldn't it be more logical to use:\n\nCONFIRMED_DEATHS/(CONFIRMED_DEATHS + CONFIRMED_RECOVERIES)\n\n\nWhich formula is applicable to which situations?\n",
        "answer": "This may not strike most as a bioinformatics, but getting the key clinical outcome is essential in understanding the molecular basis of pathogenicity.\n\nI think the mortality rate is over-reported. This is not to say the situation of 2019-nCov is not serious - it is very serious.\n\nThe two essential factors missing in your equation for 2019-nCov are:\n\n\nAge. Mortality is likely skewed towards the old and very young\nSeroprevalence. To identify the number of asymptomatic patients.\n\n\nOld people have a weakened immune system (e.g. reduced T-cell response). The very young have an underdeveloped immune system. The problem is hospital cases are skewed towards those with severe infection, which is likely the old and very young. In 2019-nCov the first infecteds were middle aged men, but likely to be restricted to those exposed to the \"Wuhan meat market\".\n\nProblem \nAsymptomatic \"spreaders\" are known in influenza and are suspected in 2019-nCov. Asymptomatics will inflate the mortality rate (because we're not detecting them).\n\nSolution(s)\n\n\nOne solution is to conduct seroprevalence surveys. Serological surveys screening for antibodies (IgG) against 2019-nCov will identify asymptomatic patients, using the first formula you stated. However, would you seriously go around the general population in a 2019-nCov epidemic taking blood samples? Errhhh no.\nThe bio-statistics approach is to use a catalytic model and critical to this is the age of the patient. Catalytic models are a priori models that incorporates the age-prevelance profile of infection. By introducing the incidence and age of hospitalisation of e.g. the old and the young, the rest of the distribution, i.e. asymptomatics can be calculated by regression. This estimates the total population of infecteds and again you use equation 1 to calculate the mortality rate recorded by the hospital.\nMathematical models based on transmission dynamics. The problem here is the rate of transmission is unknown.\n\n\nI would assume the hospital is the place virus-induced mortality is reasonably accurate.\n\nThe second formula you described works very well for Ebolavirus, no-one has ever heard of asymptomatic Ebolavirus. It would also work well for another betacoronavirus Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome. The key problem with 2019-nCov is we don't know the number of asymptomatic patients or patients with such mild infections they never report illness. \n\nSummary\nIn summary, I think the mortality is being over-reported if it is based on your equation 2. Equation 1, however, will also over-report the mortality rate.\n"

Coronavirus is of course an RNA virus and in fact, to my knowledge, every RNA virus in Genbank is present as cDNA (AGCT, i.e. thydmine) and not RNA (AGCU, i.e. uracil).\n\nThe reason is simple, we never sequence directly from RNA because RNA is too unstable and easily degraded by RNase. Instead the genome is reverse transcribed, either by targeted reverse transcription or random amplification and thus converted to cDNA. cDNA is stable and is essentially reverse transcribed RNA.\n\nThe cDNA is either sequenced directly or further amplified by PCR and then sequenced. Hence the sequence we observe is the cDNA rather than RNA, thus we observe thymine rather than uracil and that is how it is reported. \n"

It represents, in effect, the number of further cases each new case will give rise to. If R is high, the number of newly infected people climbs quickly to a peak before, for want of new people to infect, starting to fall back again (see chart 2). If R is low the curve rises and falls more slowly, never reaching the same heights. With sars-cov-2 now spread around the world, the aim of public-health policy, whether at the city, national or global scale, is to flatten the curve, spreading the infections out over time.\n\nI am having trouble with this. There are 2 curves here. First of all, I am not sure of the different processes that determine them. It says one is without measures. The other is with measures. But it also says one is with high R and the other with low R. Is R a fixed constant for a disease? Alternatively, is there some variability in R and does that degree of variation affect transmission? This is not explained or stated in the article and I haven't heard R described in this way. At best it is not written clearly in my opinion. \n\nIn addition, does without measures necessarily imply high R? Is that what they are getting at? Also, it looks to me as though the blue graph goes to zero very quickly, basically when t is equal to the mean of the orange curve. That means that without measures the epidemic will end quickly (because it exhausts all the possible patients). \n\nFinally the areas under the two curves is about the same. This means that the number of patients is about the same with or without measures. \n\nAnyway, can anyone clear up any of this?\n",
        "answer": "R is a reference to R0, otherwise known as the basic reproductive rate, and means the number of new cases from a single patient infection. R0 has to be above 1 for a disease to persist. It is a classic equation which account for the probability of transmission against immunity. The y-axis is the number of infecteds, very poorly presented.\n\nThe idea is that R0 will be lower if there is containment (less people to infect because you can't move around), but will last longer, possibly because the number of naive patients (not encountered the virus) will be larger over a longer period of time. \n\nThat particular graph appears to be saying that everyone at risk of infection will get infected with or without control measures (the surface area under the graphs is approximately the same*) and the only thing that will halt the virus is acquired immunity. If this is mainstream economic thinking then I beg to differ, albeit I note the source is CDC (again see note*). \n\nFor example, all other respiratory viral infections are seasonal. If COVID-19  is seasonal containment is the right choice, because the window of transmission is limited.\n\n*, Given this is of CDC origin I think either its a mistake, or at the very least was taken out of context, because the idea is that overall there is a lower number of people infected as a result of \"social distancing\" and that does not appear to be what the two curves show.\n"

This gene is immediately after the 20 kb of ORF1ab, including the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, its around 3.5 kb but it might be a bit bigger. The spike protein is a major B-cell (antibody) antigenic determinant and the cellular receptor sites are located within it. Your bioinformatics could ultimately focus on targeting these specific sites, in particular using antigenic (antibody) prediction algorithms. \n\nFirst you need some basic biology of spike and hydrophobicity prediction is a good starting point such as TMHMM here and consider the SARS spike protein structure for example here. Once you've a handle on those structures antigenicity scanning would be a next phase analysis and possibly homology modelling. This is because COVID-19 and SARS are closely related, but there are key differences.

        "answer": "The  evolutionary related group (clade) of betacoronaviruses you have identified share an amino acid homology of 85% and include SARS. I know this from the underlying tree published on BioRxiv of a broader group of betacoronaviruses, i.e. your data is a defined subset of the betacoronaviruses which all share a unique, single common ancester.\n\nLets call this group the SARS clade.\n\nYou have performed a nucleotide blast and asked NCBI to produce a NJ tree using 2019-nCov as the reference. I can tell this by the colour coding and the scale bar at the bottom right hand corner shows the genetic distance involved is reasonably larger than 15% divergence by amino acid data. The scale bar represents the number of mutations per nucleotide. \n\nIn summary, your tree is essentially a subset of the broader genetic diversity of the one published, but there is there is a rooting issue. \n\nIn your tree, the majority of sequences are from the 2002 SARS epidemic and the virtually zero genetic distance between them is simply because it is a rapidly transmitted outbreak. I didn't realize that SARS has two independent origins both initially from bats. This is quite scary. \n\n\n2019-nCov is an outgroup within the 'SARS clade' hence it appears at the other side of the tree, i.e. they share a more distant common ancestor\nHowever 2019-nCov is not the most distant common ancester within this subset of the betacoronaviruses, i.e. SARS clade, this belongs to the two bat viruses ZC45 and ZX21. The program has made a likely rooting error (below).\nAgain the blast omitted the majority of the betacoronaviruses, for example MERS\n\n\nRooting issue the reason I suggest there is a rooting error is because the BioRxiv tree using a broad sample of the betacoronaviruses placed the bat strains ZC45 and ZX21 as outgroups to the SARS clade and 2019-nCOV was immediately within that, so in this definition 2019-nCOV is an 'ingroup' within the SARS clade, whereas your tree it is an 'outgroup'. It not a huge issue, but the location of the \"root\" is determined by the common ancester above it (sequences with &lt;85% homology) and in your tree those have been omitted. \n\nGenerally, I like the analysis otherwise and gives an insight into SARS that I hadn't previosly been aware of.\n"

Clinical trials take a lot time as they need to be thorough (cf. the infamous thalidomide from the days with more lax testing)\n\nThere are several bottlenecks in drug design. These are technical based on our imperfect understanding of things, which results in less than ideal models. CPU time is not really an issue. Empirical validation is required at many steps along the way. This is greatly increased by automation. The XChem team at Diamond light source have done a fragment-screening against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease at an insane pace: things are changing fast!\n\nDrug screen\n\nThere are many ways to make a drug. In one way, a test system was set up (a reporter assay) that gives you a measurable read-out, say mm of clearance of bacteria on a Petri dish (viability) around a cellulose dish soaked in different separated natural extracts —and you might find that Penicillium chrysogenum has a compound of interest. What you are doing is drug screen. Screening a large panel of compounds (of varying purity) does not necessarily require knowing the protein target.\n\nRational drug design\n\nFast forward to this decade and it becomes possible to predict the free energy release upon binding of a small molecule against a protein —mostly.\n\nThis requires a solved 3D structure of the protein by X-ray crystallography. Crystallising a protein is a tricky business, as a pure protein sample has to come out of solution in a folded form to form a neat lattice as opposed to just making unfolded gunk.

Some have done deep learning on it, but the best solution is to have a robot try a very large range of combinations.\n\nOnce you have a protein structure you can predict what fits into the part that you want to target, say an active site or an interface. This is not done by simple cartesian geometric shape fitting like LEGO bricks as there are many molecular forces involved. So a mathematical model of these forces is made, called a force field. Many have been made, a lot of study has gone into these, but they are not perfect. It is all made worse by the fact that we cannot really model water properly —most models use a proxy (implicit solvent) or use non-polarisable water.\nThis is all while made worse by the fact that a protein is not static but wobbles (following the same mathematical models). So a ligand does not slot in really like a key in a lock, but has an induced fit. Modelling all this is accurately is problematic, but one can still try: calculating where exactly a ligand binds to a protein is called for which one gets energy difference upon binding. And one can try an inordinate amount of small molecules —Zinc DB contains 230 million purchasable compounds. This is called a virtual screen. One can even start with the natural substrate and \"weaponise it\" by adding chemical groups that do a chemical reaction that breaks the protein. However, a metabolite is very different from a drug (cf. Lipinski's rule of five) as the latter must cross membranes etc. But generally the accuracy is not great without multiple steps of empirical validation.\n\nTo improve the results from a virtual screen the most common approach is to do a fragment screen to guide it. This is to automatedly soak protein crystals with a large library of small compounds and see which crystal contains a bound hit. The hits can be expanded into bigger fragments in a virtual screens and the short list of compounds tested (these are not cheap) by soaking and crystallising again.\nIn the case of Covid19 virus, the cool thing is that this whole process is open in the aforementioned current campaign (Diamond is a government owned synchrotron and not a big pharma). What is really nice about this is that for the second cycle comp-chemists from everywhere have done their own guided virtual screen and have submit compounds (which you can see publicly).\n\nIt should be said that drug screens that are not rational design are still a thing. The recent antibiotic-discovering deep-learning paper in Cell]6 is such an example, although it should be said that it was a feat not only in AI but also in automated empirical testing.\n\nFuture\n\nAutomation via better and open software will definitely improve. With a small drive possibly from the dissemination of easy to use and to code off-the-shelf electronics, such as Rasperry Pis or Arduinos. But mainly with more complex machines such as the Opentron system (a python-controlled robot).\n\nBut indubitably where the greatest improvement can come is better mathematical models. Possibly even with deep learning. After all researches were amused last year-ish (2018 competition) when DeepMind \"won\" the protein 3D structure (fold) modelling competition (CASP13) and there have definitely been some really nice results in the field of docking with hybrid models. So deep-learning may still surprise us yet...\n\nLastly, open science will be a strong driver: using premade packages or tools on GitHub and code snippets from StackOverflow etc. will accelerate these.\n"

        "question": "(First time posting on this SE, I hope it's not off-topic.)\n\nI have a friend who lives in the Netherlands, let's call her Allison. Both her and her neighbor (let's call him Bob) live in an apartment complex owned by a therapy organization they are both patients at, and their landlord is also the owner of said organization. Bob has lived there longer than Allison.\n\nEvery once in a while (at least once a week, though sometimes a lot more often), Bob tends to be very noisy in his apartment, by listening to loud music or playing with a pinball machine (a physical, real life one, not a video game). This often also happens very late at night, which is obviously not allowed per contract, and the walls are incredibly thin. Allison has complained about this numerous times, as it prevents her from sleeping at night and her mental health is suffering because of it, which the therapy home was supposed to be helping with. The inhabitants of the other apartments don't hear any noise, as Allison's apartment is the only one that share's a wall with Bob's.\n\nThe problem: Since Bob is a therapy patient himself, the landlord and the therapists appear to be protective of him. Supposedly, he has his own baggage that prevents him from noticing, caring or remembering that he's being inconsiderate. While they don't explicitly condone him doing this at night, they barely take any direct action. Instead, they advised Allison to use earplugs, since the person who lived in her apartment before her never complained about this and they figured she may just be too sensitive. When the earplugs didn't help, they told her to message Bob whenever he's being too loud, because he apparently needs constant reminding that he's not supposed to do this after a certain time of day. Allison tried this, and it helped, but the silence usually only persists for a few minutes before being broken again.\n\nOn Allison's request, the landlord eventually agreed to order noise cancelling panels to be installed on the wall between their apartments. However, he only agreed to pay for the very cheapest ones available, which had to be shipped from China and are now being withheld due to the Corona virus. Furthermore, after it was clarified that these panels would need to be installed on Bob's side of the wall in order to have any effect, Bob suddenly expressed that he's not willing to put in the effort to do so. In other words, he refuses to actively do something to fix the problem he's causing, despite the panels being gifted to him (Allison has expressed willingness to invest into panels for her side of the wall out of her own pocket, just for added sound isolation, but as stated earlier, those won't do much on their own).\n\nRecently, Allison's therapist started encouraging her to look for other apartments, all of which turned out to be substantially more expensive than her current one (given similar size and quality). Despite knowing that Allison's financial situation isn't the best, her therapist kept suggesting that it might be worth it to get some peaceful nights. Allison feels like this is rather unfair, like she's being punished for her neighbor breaking the contract and keeping her up at night, and that the landlord / therapy organization should put more effort into solving this for her, as the contract states that excessive noise at night is grounds for eviction. However, whenever she brings these arguments up, they keep getting dodged.\n\nAllison tried contacting the police about this, but they dismissed her case as something that's out of their reach. They advised her to try something called a \"neighborhood mediation\", though Allison has strong doubts about the usefulness of such a thing, as the landlord and therapists have already tried mediating between the two of them.\n\nQuestion: Is there any other way to resolve this issue? Can a therapy organization get away with catering to one patient's needs, despite that being extremely counterproductive to the needs of another patient, especially if the former is the one breaking the rules? Is it legal for the landlord to blatantly ignore a contract that was signed by all the involved parties and not take any action against one of these parties breaking it and strongly inconveniencing another one? And if not, how does one get him to take action?\n",
        "answer": "\n  Can a therapy organization get away with catering to one patient's needs, despite that being extremely counterproductive to the needs of another patient, especially if the former is the one breaking the rules? Is it legal for the landlord to blatantly ignore a contract that was signed by all the involved parties and not take any action against one of these parties breaking it and strongly inconveniencing another one?\n\n\nFirst, it is important for Allison to distinguish between the existing legal relations and each one's separate ramifications.\n\nThe therapist looks manipulative and dishonest when encouraging Allison to rent a more expensive place, since at this point it seems that the therapist knew or should have known that the situation involves the landlord (who coincidentally is the therapist's employer). At the very least, the therapist should have informed Allison that the therapist has a potential conflict of interest, and thus let Allison decide whether or not to rely on that organization's services. Here, the therapist failed to make due disclosure.\n\nInstead, the therapist's acts have all the appearance of accommodating its other customer (Bob), and ultimately trying not to disrupt its employer's profits both as landlord and as therapy business owner. That conflict of interest sounds in therapist's malpractice and may even amount to [therapist's &amp; company's] fraud.\n\nRegardless of whether Allison chooses to denounce the therapist and/or the business, she should ask herself whether a therapy organization with such practices is apt for continued treatment of --and the ensuing profits from-- Allison's therapy needs. One aspect Allison needs to consider is that her continued business there would weaken her arguments if she eventually brings court proceedings against the therapist or his employer.\n\nAllison's tenancy is a separate issue. Allison knows better than I (and the public in general) the terms of her lease and the physical details of her residential unit, so only she can compare them with section 7.4.2 of the Burgerlijke Wetboek to assess whether the lack of quiet enjoyment is attributable to a defect of the leased property (article 7:204.2). Allison should assess this issue from the standpoint of landlord's possible allegation that \"\"the disturbance is caused by a third person\" (whereby the landlord would seek to avoid liability under 7:204.3). Depending on Allison's determination of the aforementioned issue, she would have a claim against the landlord for breach of contract, and/or against Bob for tortious conduct (6:162).\n\nThere are at least three reasons why Allison should follow the police's suggestion of neighborhood mediation. The first reason is that there has been essentially no mediation in Allison's dispute. Mediation requires a nonparty whose neutrality is not compromised when conducting the mediation. That has been missing here so far. Allison has only dealt with third parties (i.e., the landlord and therapists) who are first and foremost reluctant to inconvenience their noisy client Bob for fear of affecting their own business interests. Allison's belief that these people were conducting a form of mediation is mistaken.\n\nThe second reason is that, from mediation, Allison may pursue and obtain a written &amp; signed agreement whereby Bob promises to desist from his pattern of disturbances (ideally Allison would secure an akin sort of commitment also from the landlord). In the event that Allison subsequently needs to sue either or both of the parties for the continued disturbances, filing in court these binding documents (which she would have obtained through mediation) will ease Allison's burden of proof.\n\nThe third reason is that genuine mediation might obviate Allison's need to seek remedies in court. That is because it would teach both landlord and Bob that Allison is able and willing to take legal action if the situation persists or escalates, which might have a dissuading effect on them. Furthermore, mediation proceedings will give Allison some experience as to presenting her legal arguments in a more formal setting.\n\nCourts in Netherlands may grant injunctive relief in situations like Allison's where the ongoing harm is not susceptible of being quantified in monetary terms. Allison may pursue that relief, which if granted would compel the police to enforce it each time Bob violates it.\n"

        "question": "So I live in a city that has these organizers who are newspaper owners that are about to go forward with a huge event that brings people from all over despite the fact that I just saw the coronavirus numbers increase by 18 in the past 24 hours here in the United States.\n\nIf this event results in an outbreak in my city, is there a legal precedent for a lawsuit against these organizers? Has anything like this been done before?\n",
        "answer": "Lawsuits are only allowed for harms to a particular private individual's health that actually arises from the conduct of the person sued. You can't sue because there was an outbreak in your city, you have to show individualized harm to you.\n\nTo prevail you would have to make out a \"negligence\" claim. The elements of this claim are (1) a duty, (2) that was breached, (3) by someone with injuries, (4) that were caused by the breach of duty.\n\nThere are two kinds of duties. One is the general duty to use the care of a reasonable person to prevent foreseeable harm to others (a breach of this duty is called \"negligence\"). The other is to obey statutes and regulations and ordinances intended to protect people like the person injured from the harm suffered.\n\nIf someone doesn't violate a statute, regulation, or ordinance, then one has to show that it as negligent to carry out the event.\n\nThere would also be an affirmative defense that the fault was entirely that of the victim by attending the event knowing of the risk.\n\nI wouldn't rule out negligence liability for event organizers, but it is more likely that they would be sued not for holding the event, but for failure to use reasonable care in how it was conducted (e.g. not having face masks and hand sanitizer on hand).\n"

        "question": "What can we do with those people who still decided to travel (for skiing, example) and causing huge problems after they return, even though they know the fact that corona virus (or anything new in the future) is deadly and already spreading around the world?\n\n--\nUpdate:\n\nAccording to Phillip, I want to point out a specific country like Finland, with Finnish law, for Finnish people who traveled to Italy.\n\n--\nUpdate 2:\n\nI asked this question because I think in this way: If you're drunk and going to drive, and because of your irresponsible action could lead to the danger for some (one, two, maybe ten people), so you will be punished, even when you have not made a scratch to anybody.\n\nBut then why do there are people who would do something which leads to the danger of thousands of people, free to walk away?\n\n\n\nOf course, we can exclude people who do not know, and people who have important things to do.\n",
        "answer": "Communicable diseases are endemic to the human condition\n\nSome places, times and situations are riskier than others but there is always a risk in widespread travel. Outside of disease spread, there are other risks in travel; for example, if no-one traveled at all there would be no motor vehicle deaths.\n\nOn the flip-side, not traveling has its own dangers; for example, you will not die in a house fire if you are in your car.\n\nOf course, there are enormous benefits to widespread travel;  economic, cultural and personal - life is to be experienced after all.\n\nIf you stop the skier from skiing, then you have just damaged the livelihood of all the people who depend on tourism; the airline, the hotel, the bartender, the ski technician, the baker in the ski resort etc.\n\nEverything is allowed unless it is prohibited\n\nBy and large, this is the way that the law works. It's legal to do anything you like. Unless it isn't.\n\nIt isn't illegal to travel to, say, Finland. So you can.\n\nIf the government (of whichever country) decides that the costs of allowing people to travel to Finland now outweigh the benefits then they can prohibit it. However, that is a political decision; not a legal one.\n\nAs for your drink-driving example, I am old enough to remember when it wasn't illegal to drive drunk, although I was too young to drive. Of course, if you are in Somalia or Kenya it's still legal. Also, what counts a drunk varies by country - you can have a couple in Finland but cross over into Russia and you are breaking the law. Why does Finland allow such recklessness? Because it's a political decision and politicians in Finland and Russia have reached different conclusions about what level of risk is acceptable. Same with travel restrictions.\n"
