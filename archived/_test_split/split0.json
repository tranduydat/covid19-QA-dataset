Would it be catastrophic?.\", 'answer_id': '89712', 'answer': 'Can someone die of the common cold?..No. .The common cold is a clinical syndrome restricted to upper respiratory tract involvement. By clinical syndrome, I mean it is the constellation of symptoms (rather than the consequence of a specific pathogen). As you mention, these symptoms are the result of the immune response, rather than tissue damage or compromised function as a direct effect of a pathogen or its toxin (e.g., the watery diarrhea in cholera).  ..As defined (see, e.g., Cecil Medicine Ch. 369), this clinical syndrome cannot lead to death. ...  The common cold is an upper respiratory syndrome of rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction, frequently accompanied by sore throat, sneezing, and cough....Can the viruses that cause the common cold cause death?..Yes. Many viruses that cause the common cold also cause other clinical syndromes that can cause death. This occurs when viral replication moves to the lower respiratory tract. As an example, influenza viruses are responsible for 25 - 30% of common colds (see Bennett, Principles and Practice of Infectious Disease, Ch.58). When it moves beyond the upper respiratory tract, influenza is responsible for substantial mortality. Other virus families that are responsible for both a common cold syndrome and lower respiratory tract syndrome in immunocompetent individuals (e.g., bronchiolitis, pneumonia) include parainfluenza virus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and (rarely) coronavirus. Rhinovirus, responsible for 40-50% of common cold cases, is uniquely unsuited to lower respiratory tract involvement, because of its preference for the cooler environment of the nasal mucosa, replicating best at 33 C (Murray Medical Microbiology, Ch 56). However, in individuals with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), lower respiratory tract involvement does occur. There are a number of case series reporting death due to lower respiratory rhinovirus. This is an example...Can the common cold lead to serious illnesses other than lower respiratory tract involvement?..Yes. Other morbidity can occur as a result of the immune response that produces the common cold syndrome. Rhinorrhea and congestion can progress to a viral rhinosinusitis, a separate syndrome with its own complications, or a secondary bacterial infection, which can lead to bacterial sinus involvement and/or bacterial lower respiratory tract infection. Otitis media is another common complication, especially in children, and has its own potential complications. Asthma (and, generally speaking, most lung diseases) can also be exacerbated by what would otherwise be a simple common cold and predisposes to lower respiratory tract involvement.

In general, virus reproduction kills cells, and when cells die faster than the host can replace them, this causes symptoms up to and including death. The host's immune system supresses virus activity, and a virus that can't evolve ways to avoid immune supression will be wiped out.

For example, the Ebola virus has a very high case fatality rate of up to 90%...However, those aren't the only ways in which you could define 'dangerous'. We might also consider the total number of people that the virus can kill. This often isn't a linear relationship with the case fatality rate. Often, viruses with a high case fatality rate 'burn out' before than can inflict a global pandemic, because people die before they can spread the disease on to others. Vice versa, viruses with a relatively low case fatality rate, such as the Spanish Flu (2-3%) can be extremely 'dangerous' and kill millions of people. ..But there is no hard and fast rule, as the propensity of a virus to cause a global pandemic is influenced by many, many other factors. ..So to answer your question: is it possible for the Covid-19 to mutate into something as dangerous as Ebola? Well, if we are thinking about it's pathogenicity - Influenza A H5N1 (bird flu) had a case fatality rate of about 60%, which is pretty high for a flu virus. For context, the seasonal flu which has a case fatality rate of about 0.1%. I'm not an expert in Virology, so it would be great if someone with more knowledge could confirm this, but it seems very unlikely that the Covid-19 virus could acquire mutations to the degree where it would kill as high as 90% of the people who acquire it, like Ebola does. Ebola is a hemorrhagic virus, which is a totally different mechanism of pathogenicity to the Coronavirus family.  ..It's plausible that Covid-19 could obtain mutations which allow it to transfer more quickly between humans. For example, we know that the Spanish Flu acquired mutations in hemagglutinin subtype which allowed it to be more transmissible between humans. Generally, Coronaviruses have relatively lower R0 rates than other disease (~2/3 compared to Measles which is 12-18). The total number of people killed by the Ebola outbreak was about 11,000.

Therefore we must protect the mRNA by mixing it with some other chemical, in this case a mixture of positively charged lipids. The positively charged lipids are attracted to the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the mRNA, and form a nanoparticle trapping the mRNA inside and hiding it from the nucleases. The lipids are often, but not always, PEGylated, which means that a molecule of polyethylene glycol (PEG) is attached to the lipid. The PEG groups form a layer on the outer surface of the nanoparticle that helps prevent protein binding...These mRNA lipid nanoparticles are then injected into a patient. This will probably be an intramuscular injection so that the particles are most likely to be taken up by muscle cells. The exact mechanism explaining why lipid nanoparticles are attracted to cells isn't entirely clear, but it's likely a combination of electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nanoparticle and the negatively charged cell membrane and proteins that bind to the nanoparticle and are then recognized by receptors on the cell surface...After the particle is taken up by a cell it is usually trapped inside a membrane-bound structure called an endosome. As the endosome matures it is acidified, and as the pH drops from about 7 to about 5.5 the nanoparticle is disrupted. The lipids that made up the nanoparticle can merge with the lipids that make up the endosomal membrane, disrupting that membrane and breaking open the endosome, allowing the mRNA to escape into the cytoplasm...Once in the cytoplasm the mRNA will find a ribosome and produce protein.

The basic idea is that infectious \\'organisms\\' (including viruses) may face a tradeoff between their ability to produce lots of infectious particles (e.g. by replicating faster within the host) and the length of time that they can stay in the host before it dies or activates immune defenses sufficiently to end the infection. In this case, some intermediate level of virulence may evolve...Evolution of virulence in ways predicted by the theory has been observed in the real world in such diseases as myxomatosis (a viral disease of rabbits). The theory has also been suggested to apply in HIV and syphilis...The actual forecast can depend on many details of the biology and epidemiology of a particular organism. If COVID-19 happened to have a higher-than-optimal virulence in humans at the time of emergence, we could expect its virulence to decline over time. It could also decline if epidemic control was applied in such as way as to differentially affect more-virulent strains; this has been suggested by Tang et al. on the basis of the pattern of mutations in different strains, although their logic has also been criticized on Twitter by an expert in genetic epidemiology, and now by a more official rebuttal by McLean et al. (with some back-and-forth discussion between the authors and critics)...This explanation doesn\\'t include the possibility of host evolution, which is theoretically important but not really relevant to COVID-19 &mdash; it would only happen over many generations, and only if the epidemic was so severe that it was a significant overall cause of death or failure to reproduce ........Tang et al. \"On the origin and continuing evolution of SARS-CoV-2\", National Science Review, nwaa036, https://doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwaa036 ..Read, Andrew F. \"The evolution of virulence.\" Trends in microbiology 2.3 (1994): 73-76...', 'answer_type': 'Accepted', 'wrong_answer': 'I would like to add to the great answer by AliceD with my own experiment.

(Or, more formally, we fuse our senses in a remarkable way)..The bill of materials is daunting:...Two spoons.Willing test subject...In my case, the subject was my girlfriend at the time...It is known that we use spectral effects to determine the elevation angle of a sound.  Our ears and our shoulders are known to shape the sound, emphasizing some frequencies and muting others.  Of course, this process is impossible to do if you don\\'t know what the sound was \"originally.\"  If you don\\'t know what the sound was as it reached you, you can\\'t figure out how much the ears have colored it...For this experiment I picked two spoons, and verbally described what I was going to do.  I was going to click the spoons in various places and have her reach for them.  I intentionally did not click the spoons together in this demonstration because I did not want her to get to hear the spoons until the experiment started...I first asked her to close her eyes.  I clicked the spoons in various places, and she identified which direction she thought it came from.  She was reliably accurate in left/right direction, because she could hear the time delays between the sound hitting her left and right ear.  However, her elevation angle was rather random.  There did not appear to be any pattern at all to it...Then I asked her to open her eyes, and do a very boring version of this experiment.  With her eyes open, she of course was able to point to the clicking spoons 100% of the time.  (This was actually the hardest part, because it seems absurd to the test subject.  They start to think it\\'s a trick)...Then, I had her close her eyes again, and repeat the experiment.  The results?  She was dead on every time.  Didn\\'t miss a single one, both azimuth and elevation...So what do I claim happened?  When we started the experiment, she did not know the frequency spectra of the spoons clicking.  As such, she could not effectively back out what transform her ears and shoulders were applying, and could not figure out elevation angles.  She could make some guesses, as a human that has heard things clacking together, but that was insufficient to accomplish the task...In the boring second phase, she could now fuse the information she got from her eyes in with that from her ears.  Now she could determine what angle the sound was coming from with her eyes, figure out what the transform of her ears/shoulders should be, and back out what the \"true\" sound of the spoons was...In the third phase, she now knew the \"true\" sound of the spoons, so whenever soundwaves hit her ears, she could use that knowledge to figure out what transform her ears/shoulders must have been applying, and figure out angles...I used this to argue that we can hear with our eyes, but it might be more effective to say that the brain doesn\\'t pay as much attention to the division between the 5 senses as we do when we talk about our sensory experience.

See reference 3 for details...3. The spike protein of SARS-CoV contains a unique inserted sequence (1378 bp) located in the middle of its spike glycoprotein gene that had no match in other coronaviruses:..As shown in reference 4, the sequence comparision of the SARS-CoV-2 with closely related other corona viruses shows that this sequence is not unique to the new virus but is already present in older strains. It shows some difference due to inserted mutations...4. The claim that SARS-CoV-2 contains four insertions from HIV-1:..The paper claiming this has now been retracted due to severe criticism, and additionally a renowned HIV expert published an analysis (reference 5) demonstrating that the HIV-1 claimed insertions are random rather than targeted...5.

I’d wager the answer is temperature...Protimes are performed at 37 degrees in order to simulate the in vivo environment, but also because most coagulation factors aren't active at room temp, or at least they are very slow-acting at room temp. Heating the environment speeds this process up so the test doesn't take all day...Now, we know if you take a tube of warm normal plasma and add calcium and thrombin to it, it clots right away, right? But this is a problem because the thrombin time is a quantitative assay and we need it to be sensitive, especially for those super old-school clinicians who use it to monitor heparin instead of a more modern test like the APTT or Xa inhibition. We need to be able to tell the difference between a patient that’s gotten a bolus of heparin and a direct thrombin inhibitor. So, if you remove the heat, you slow down the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, and in the process you stretch the calibration curve, effectively increasing the sensitivity of the test. But this also has the effect of slowing down the conversion to where it takes 14–18 seconds rather than one or two...If you change your test setup to have the thrombin reagent heated, my hunch is that your analyzer will give an error because the sample will have clotted by the time the analyzer reaches minimum threshold time. Or better yet, try this experiment on a fibrometer. I don’t have access to one so I can’t try it out as I’d like to...I’d be interested in discussing this with any other experts out there, especially those that have played around in the coag lab.

Here, we present an analysis of 1,391 manually curated sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors, their functions, genomic organization and evolutionary conservation....The numbers are somewhat higher now. Wingender et al. have counted 1,558 human genes in their TFClass database 2013 NAR paper. In their 2014 NAR paper they included 1,557 human, 1,147 mouse and 1,105 rat orthologs...Another way to look for this information is to see the number of entries listed in TF databases, like for example JASPAR. This has the advantage of including other species. However, the coverage here depends on the availability of position weight matrices (PWMs) for the binding specificities. Many uncharacterized TFs may not be found.....To try to answer your third question, that is, what is the proportion of TFs in the different species, a naive approach would be to divide the number of predicted TFs by the number of predicted genes in the target genome. For example, taking the latest estimates above with the predicted number of coding genes from Ensembl database (version 78) will return these percentages:..# Human.100 * 1557 / 20364 = 7.64%.# Mouse.100 * 1147 / 22606 = 5.07%.# Rat.100 * 1105 / 22777 = 4.85%...This suggests humans have a slightly higher proportion of TFs than rodents. However, these differences are not too big and may be dependent on the accuracy of the different estimates on TFs and gene numbers. An in itself, these numbers are not so interesting...A much more interesting question is whether TF families have expanded more or less in different species (that is, whether the number of  proteins within each family has increased, regardless of the proportion to the total number of genes in the genome). I could find at least one paper where this has been done systematically for several eukaryotic species, covering animals, plants and fungi, and focusing on TFs common to the ones found in plants. The main conclusion of the paper is that some TFs families have expanded more in plants than in other organisms. Quoted from the abstract:...  To investigate if differences exist in the expansion patterns of TF gene families between plants and other eukaryotes, we first used Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) TFs to identify TF DNA-binding domains. These DNA-binding domains were then used to identify related sequences in 25 other eukaryotic genomes. Interestingly, among 19 families that are shared between animals and plants, more than 14 are larger in plants than in animals. After examining the lineage-specific expansion of TF families in two plants, eight animals, and two fungi, we found that TF families shared among these organisms have undergone much more dramatic expansion in plants than in other eukaryotes. Moreover, this elevated expansion rate of plant TF is not simply due to higher duplication rates of plant genomes but also to a higher degree of expansion compared to other plant genes...', 'wrong_answer_type': 'Random', 'url': 'biology.stackexchange.com', 'source': 'biomedical'}",

On a per-site level, DNA viruses typically have mutation rates on the order of 10E-8 to 10E-6 substitutions per nucleotide site per cell infection (s/n/c). RNA viruses, however, have higher mutation rates that range between 10E−6 and 10E−4 s/n/c...Again, wouldn\\'t that mean that a single host could 1) easily generate many mutations of the same virus and 2) pass most of those uniquely generated mutations to another host?

There is some distribution of number of mutational events that will occur as a function of the number of new RNA molecules created per cell and the replication error rate. Some subset of these RNA molecules will be packaged into new particles, yielding a new generation of viruses that get a chance to infect. Yes, this is potentially a large number of new mutations per infection event..Some large proportion of these new particles will contain non-functional RNAs, due to inactivating mutations of one kind or another. Most of the new mutations will be worse at being a virus than the originally infecting virus (their immediate parent). So therefore, they will be outcompeted by non-mutated forms..Among all those viruses which continue successfully infecting throughout the course of a year, on average we observe 24 substitution mutations in the genome over the course of that year. Every transmission chain included in the group of viruses at the end of the year must have remained viable for infection of hosts. In other words, it has survived natural selection....In population genetics, this phenomenon is known as \"mutation-selection balance\"- e.g. new mutations arise in the population at a rate that is limited by the action of natural selection (at equilibrium)...Genotype-phenotype maps..What of course I am leaving unstated is exactly why \"...new mutations will be worse at being a virus than the originally infecting virus...\"..This is very hard to predict in many cases.

If those characteristics change when pathogens mutate (which happens fairly frequently), your immune system will not recognize it as readily (or initially at all).  .... Long Answer ..Sore throat is most commonly attributed to pharyngitis, or the inflammation of the back of the throat called the pharynx...Causes..Sore throats can be caused by many things. (e.g., see here, summarized below):..First off, a sore throat can be the result of many things unrelated to illness: ...Allergies.Dryness.Irritants.Excessive talking,singing,shouting,etc..Muscle Strain.Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)...As a result, at least 30+% (higher in adults) of reported sore throat cases (and supposedly many more unreported cases) are not due to any type of illness. ..Further, a number of pathogens can cause a sore throat:...Viruses...Rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, adenoviruses, Epstein–Barr, etc..(see here for one estimate of relative etiologies). ..Bacteria...A number of bacterial infections can cause a sore throat. The most common is Streptococcus pyogenes (aka \"Strep A\"). ....It turns out that pathogen-caused pharyngitis is fairly common. Supposedly 10% of adults with sore throats have strep, and around 70% of children pharyngitis cases seen by doctors are either virally or bacterially caused.  ...However, it should be noted that only 20-30% of children and just 5-10% of adults have bacteria to blame for their sore throat, with viral infections being much more common. (source: IDSA)....Sore Throat Frequency..It turns out that sore throats are fairly common; Jones (2004) determined that about 7.5% of people have a sore throat in any three-month period. Further, on average, adults get a sore throat two to three times a year and children about five times a year (Tamparo 2011 and Rutter &amp; Newby 2015), so your personal experience is fairly average...Because viral causes and non-pathogenic causes make up an overwhelming percentage of overall sore throat cases, it shouldn\\'t be surprising that most sore throats clear up without the use of any antibiotics. ..As for those that are caused by pathogens:..Why no Immunity?..Bacteria and viruses both mutate fairly quickly (see Antigenic Variation, Antigenic Drift and Antigenic Shift), so it shouldn\\'t be surprising that you\\'re capable of having an immune response to pathogens throughout life. ...If we consider just strep alone, it mutates/reemerges with improved fitness frequently (e.g., see Bao et al 2016 and their citations).And see Sanjuán et al. (2010) for a reviewof viral mutation rates. ...So not only are there a number of pathogens that can cause sore throat, but each of these pathogens can mutate. That leaves you with a fairly sizable number of potential invaders that can illicit a sore throat. ..Let\\'s See How Your Immune System Responds:..Your immune system contains cells that can be split into two broad groups: cells that belong to the adaptive immune system, and cells which belong to the innate immune system. [See here for a simple explanation]....Innate Immune system: consists of cells responsible for initial detection of pathogens, recruitment of other immune cells, activation of the complement system, engulfment and (more immediate) destruction of pathogens. .Adaptive immune system: consists of cells which coordinate to develop a memory of the infections they\\'ve seen previously in order to mount a faster, more pronounced immune response to repeat pathogens....Depending on the kind of foreign invasion, two different immune responses can occur in either of these 2 broader \"systems\": either a humoral response involving antibodies or a cell-mediated repsponse.....A general feature of the immune system is that these mechanisms rely on detecting structural features of the pathogen or toxin that mark it as distinct from host cells (see Chaplin 2010 for a review). The mechanisms permitting recognition of pathogenic/toxic foreign structures can be broken down into two general categories: ...hard-wired responses encoded by genes that recognize molecular patterns shared both by many microbes and toxins that are not present in the mammalian host. This is the innate system described above..responses that are encoded by gene elements that somatically rearrange to assemble antigen-binding molecules with extreme specificity for individual unique foreign structures. This is the adaptive system described above....Antibodies recognizes a unique/specific molecule of the harmful agent, called an antigen, and binds to it to tag it for immune attack.  ......  Because the adaptive system is composed of small numbers of cells with specificity for any individual pathogen the responding cells must proliferate after encountering the antigen in order to attain sufficient numbers to mount an effective response against the microbe or the toxin. [Source: Chaplin 2010].....This means that you can still experience some mild symptoms due to the invading pathogen. ....The important take-away from all this, though, is that your immune response relies on structural \"markers\" on pathogens in order to recognize them. This is true for both innate and adaptive immune responses. If the physical/structural properties of a pathogen change (due to antigenic processes and mutations as mentioned above) your immune system will be slower (and possibly ineffective) in responding to an attack.  ...The result, then, could be another one of those sore throats........Citations...Bao, Yun-Juan et al. “Phenotypic Differentiation of Streptococcus Pyogenes Populations Is Induced by Recombination-Driven Gene-Specific Sweeps.” Scientific Reports 6 (2016): 36644.

In this case and that of SARS-CoV-2, mutations consume the narrative, even though individual mutations seldom become fixed during outbreaks nor modulate complex virological traits. Rather, mutation is a humdrum aspect of life for an RNA virus. Because these viruses employ an intrinsically error-prone RNA polymerase for replication, their genomes will accumulate mutations during every copying cycle. Moreover, these cycles can occur on the order of hours, ensuring that a diverse virus population will be generated within a single infected host. While this amazing capacity to mutate fuels the engine of evolutionary change, most mutations adversely impact some aspect of virus function and are removed by natural selection.

When we talk about a species evolving or a species being different today than it was X years ago, we are referring to the species as a whole. Of course evolution is an ongoing process, selective pressures are shaping our gene pool constantly. However, in order to say that humans are different today to those of 1859, we would need to show that the prevalence of particular genotypes has changed.

This is not something that has recently evolved in response to HIV but is the result of an ancestral mutation. The article itself states that:...  Using formulas that estimate how long genetic mutations have been.  around, researchers have discovered that the mutation dates to the.  Middle Ages. ...Granted, this could be a good example of selection in action. If, after many, many more generations, this mutation has spread to the majority, or a significant percentage, of the population, we could point to it as an example of how humans have changed under the selective pressure of HIV infection. In order for this to happen, HIV will have to become common enough that having a resistance to is beneficial to a very large subset of humanity. I would expect to see such selective pressure in, for example, countries like South Africa where 12% of the population is HIV positive. Such pressure, however, will be negligible in countries with lower infection rates. In the US, for example, a recent study found HIV incidence among persons aged 13 years and older to be 42,200–54,000. Since the US has ~312 million people, 54,000 represents ~0.02% of the population. This will not provide enough of a selective pressure to observe differences in the short term evolutionary scale. ..We do not, in fact, \"evolve quickly in response to parasites viruses etc\". Pathogens may apply selective pressure yes. But this is not a quick process. In any case, we do not evolve in response to them. Mutations occur, randomly usually, and if they confer an advantage they may be selected for. Said advantage may be because they confer resistance to disease but even then, the original mutation was not \"in response\" to the pathogen, However, such selection happens over many successive generations and will spread relatively slowly (quickly by evolutionary standards perhaps, but still slow for us, and certainly slower than 7 generations) across the population. The same holds true of epigenetic changes. Even if they can (as now seems likely) be transmitted down the generations, any selective advantage they confer will still act at the generational level...So, while we are, of course, constantly evolving, there are no significant differences between the humans of today and those of Darwin\\'s times. Sure, some genotypes may exist today that did not then and vice versa. These, however, are not representative of the species\\' genome. They may become so after many generations but, even if they exist, they have not had time to propagate through the gene pool and cannot be taken as evidence that H. sapiens as a species is \"different\" today..', 'wrong_answer_type': 'Random', 'url': 'biology.stackexchange.com', 'source': 'biomedical'}",

Other parts of the virus are less consistent, either because they are flexible or because they are produced slightly differently each time. The nucleic acid core is often arranged semi-randomly, and the lipid envelope of many viruses can vary greatly, dependent on the process by which parts of the host cell's membrane is pinched off to create new viral particles.

By this definition, the current case fatality rate of 2019-nCov according to your quoted figures is 362 / 17491 ≈ 2.07%...(The tracker seems to have been updated since you asked your question, and now lists a total of 20679 confirmed cases and 427 deaths, for a CFR of 427 / 20679 ≈ 2.06%.)..*) As a theoretical definition of the mortality rate in the long run, when all infected patients have either died or recovered, it can sort of make sense.  But then it becomes equivalent to the usual definition of the case fatality rate.....To compare this with your definition of \"mortality rate\" (as Nd /  (Nd + Nr), where Nr is the number of individuals who have recovered from the disease), we need to start by observing that there\\'s no single universal and unambiguous definition of what \"recovering from a disease\" means.  Commonly used definitions tend to be something like \"no symptoms for X days\" and/or \"viral load below N particles per mL for X days\" or simply \"whenever a doctor declares that you\\'re healthy again and lets you out of the hospital\"...Now, let\\'s say that we\\'re using a (somewhat) objective definition of recovery like \"no detectable symptoms for two days\".  The first observation is that any epidemic first observed less than two days ago would, according to your definition, inevitably have a mortality rate of 100% simply because none of the people infected so far would have had time to be considered definitely recovered yet.  (That is assuming that at least one person had died from the infection; otherwise both the numerator and the denominator would be zero, and the rate thus undefined.)..Further, even after some of the earliest cases have been symptom-free long enough to be counted as recovered, your definition would still yield a highly upwards biased estimate of the \"true\" long-term fatality rate during the early phase of the epidemic, when the number of new cases per day is still increasing.  This is because, for most infectious diseases, any deaths typically occur when the disease is at its most severe state, whereas those who survive the disease will then experience a gradual decline in symptoms as their immune system succeeds in halting and reversing the progress of the infection.....For an illustrative example, let\\'s consider a hypothetical disease with a theoretical 1% long-term average CFR — that is to say, exactly 1% of all (recognizably) infected patients will die of the disease.  Let\\'s further assume that this disease typically takes two days to progress from the initial onset of recognizable symptoms to the state of maximum severity, which is when most of the deaths occur.  After this, assuming that the patient survives, the symptoms gradually decline over the following three days.  As remission is possible (but rare), doctors will generally consider a patient recovered only after showing no symptoms for at least two days.  Thus, a typical case would progress as follows:...  onset of symptoms → increasing symptoms (2 days) → peak severity → declining symptoms (3 days) → no symptoms → observation (2 days) → officially recovered (total time: approx. 7 days from onset)...or, for the 1% of patients for whom the disease is fatal:...  onset of symptoms → increasing symptoms (2 days) → death (total time: approx. 2 days from onset)...Now, let\\'s assume that, during the early period of an epidemic when the infection is still spreading exponentially, the number of new cases increases by a factor of 10 every three days.  Thus, during this period, the number of new cases, recoveries and deaths per day might grow approximately as follows (assuming for the sake of the example that exactly 1%, rounded down, of the patients diagnosed on each day will die two days later):..    |     cases     |   recovered   |     deaths    |         |            |  .day |   new | total |   new | total |   new | total | Nd / Ni | Nd/(Nd+Nr) |.----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---------+------------+.  1 |     1 |     1 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |.  2 |     2 |     3 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |.  3 |     5 |     8 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |.  4 |    10 |    18 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |.  5 |    20 |    38 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |.  6 |    50 |    88 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |.  7 |   100 |   188 |     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |        N/A |.  8 |   200 |   388 |     1 |     1 |     0 |     0 |   0.00% |       0.0% |.  9 |   500 |   888 |     2 |     3 |     1 |     1 |   0.11% |      25.0% |. 10 |  1000 |  1888 |     5 |     8 |     2 |     3 |   0.16% |      27.3% |. 11 |  2000 |  3888 |    10 |    18 |     5 |     8 |   0.21% |      30.8% |. 12 |  5000 |  8888 |    20 |    38 |    10 |    18 |   0.20% |      32.1% |...As you can see from the table above, naïvely calculating the case fatality rate as (total number of deaths) / (total number of cases) during this exponential growth period does underestimate the true long-term CFR by a factor of (in this case) about 5 due to the two-day lag time between infection and death.  On the other hand, using your formula of (total deaths) / (total deaths + recovered) would overestimate the true CFR by a factor of about 30!..Meanwhile, let\\'s assume that, after the first 12 days, the growth of the epidemic saturates at 10,000 new cases per day.  Now the total numbers will look like this:..    |     cases     |   recovered   |     deaths    |         |            |  .day |   new | total |   new | total |   new | total | Nd / Ni | Nd/(Nd+Nr) |.----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---------+------------+. 13 | 10000 | 18888 |    50 |    88 |    20 |    38 |   0.20% |      30.2% |. 14 | 10000 | 28888 |    99 |   187 |    50 |    88 |   0.30% |      32.0% |. 15 | 10000 | 38888 |   198 |   385 |   100 |   188 |   0.48% |      32.8% |. 16 | 10000 | 48888 |   495 |   880 |   100 |   288 |   0.59% |      24.7% |. 17 | 10000 | 58888 |   990 |  1870 |   100 |   388 |   0.66% |      17.2% |. 18 | 10000 | 68888 |  1980 |  3850 |   100 |   488 |   0.71% |      11.2% |. 19 | 10000 | 78888 |  4950 |  8800 |   100 |   588 |   0.74% |       6.3% |. 20 | 10000 | 88888 |  9900 | 18700 |   100 |   688 |   0.77% |       3.5% |. 21 | 10000 | 98888 |  9900 | 28600 |   100 |   788 |   0.80% |       2.7% |...As you can see, the two measures of mortality rate do eventually start converging as the growth of the epidemic slows down.  In fact, in the long run, as the majority of patients either recover or die, they do both end up converging to the \"true\" long-term case fatality rate of 1%.  But by then, the epidemic will be basically over...There are various ways to obtain a more accurate estimate of the long-term fatality rate even during the early exponential growth phase of an epidemic.  One such method would be to look at the outcomes of a single cohort of patients diagnosed at the same time.  For our hypothetical example epidemic, looking e.g. at just the 1000 patients diagnosed on day 10, we could get an accurate estimate of the CFR by day 12 simply by dividing the 10 deaths within that cohort by the total number of patients in the cohort.  Furthermore, observing multiple cohorts would give us a pretty good idea of how long after diagnosis we would need to wait before the estimated case fatality rate for each cohort gets close to its final true value...Unfortunately carrying out this kind of cohort analysis for 2019-nCov would require more detailed information than the tracker you\\'ve linked to provides.  Even the time series spreadsheet the tracker links to doesn\\'t directly provide such detailed cohort data, although it might be possible to obtain better estimates from it by making some more or less reasonable assumptions about the typical progress of the disease.....Addendum: A few preliminary cohort studies of the kind I describe above do appear to have already been published for 2019-nCoV...In particular, \"A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern\" by Wang et al. and \"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\" by Huang et al., both published on January 24 in The Lancet, note that, out of the first 41 patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV before Jan 2, 2020 in Wuhan, six had died (and 28 had been discharged, leaving seven hospitalized) by Jan 22, giving a case fatality rate of 14.6% in this cohort...However, they do advise treating this figure with due caution, noting a number of reasons (besides just the small number of cases examined) why it may not fully reflect the eventual long-term CFR:...  \"However, both of these [CFR] estimates [of 14.6% from the 41 patient cohort and of 2.9% from all 835 cases confirmed at the time of writing] should be treated with great caution because not all patients have concluded their illness (ie, recovered or died) and the true number of infections and full disease spectrum are unknown. Importantly, in emerging viral infection outbreaks the case-fatality ratio is often overestimated in the early stages because case detection is highly biased towards the more severe cases. As further data on the spectrum of mild or asymptomatic infection becomes available, one case of which was documented by Chan and colleagues, the case-fatality ratio is likely to decrease.\"...There\\'s also a later paper titled \"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study\" by Chen et al., published on Jan 30, that examines a cohort of 99 patients diagnosed between Jan 1 to Jan 20 and reports a CFR of 11% within this cohort.

It makes sense. Typically, bigger animals -- with corresponding bigger heads -- have bigger brains:....But what you want to know is whether the difference remains after accounting for head size. In other words, is the difference disproportionate to head size?..Adjusting TBV by ICV..Here we use a method called residualizing to remove the effect of ICV on TBV we observed above. You can find the code we're using here, and a reference describing the procedure in detail here...Let's check the graph of TBV vs ICV again, to make sure the effect is removed.....Revisiting TBV in Males vs Females..Here we'll reexamine the difference between Male and Female brain sizes using the adjusted values.....The difference is still statistically significant, but smaller. The linear model estimates the adjusted average difference to be 23.6 milliliters (compared to 153.9 before).

Now your next question may be, so what? Do these differences in brain volume explain anything about behavior or ability? That's where papers like the one you referenced come in. ..Gur et. al. suggest in their paper that females compensate for smaller total brain volume by having increased gray matter, and therefore more tissue available for computation.

So, yes, fasting while wounded tends to be a not so good idea:...  Basics in nutrition and wound healing:.  Therefore, local wound management and good documentation of the wound is essential for non-delayed wound healing and prevention of the development of chronic wounds. During the wound-healing process much energy is needed. The energy for the building of new cells is usually released from body energy stores and protein reserves. This can be very challenging for undernourished and malnourished patients....From that article:.Influence of undernutrition on wound healing.Even in uncomplicated starvation, as during a prolonged fasting, the body of an average adult subject loses 60 to 70 g of protein (240–280 g of muscle tissue) per day. However, severe trauma or sepsis can increase the loss of body protein up to 150 to 250 g (600–1000 g of muscle tissue) per day. Wound healing is delayed in subjects who had periods of starvation (simple or stress starvation) before injury or a surgical procedure due to the lack of endogenous substrates. Further undernutrition impedes wound healing in addition to:...Delayed neovascularization and decreased collagen synthesis   .Prolonged phase of inflammation.Decreased phagocytosis by leukocytes.Dysfunction of B and T cells.Decreased mechanical strength of the skin....  Proteins.  .  Proteins play the most important role throughout the entire wound-healing process. Lymphocytes, leukocytes, phagocytes, monocytes, and macrophagesdimmune system cellsdare mainly comprised of proteins and are necessary to initiate a healthy inflammatory response in the healing process. An adequate supply with proteins is necessary for consistent wound healing. Because collagen is the protein that is produced mainly in the healing wound, a lack of protein decreases the synthesis of collagen and the production of fibroblasts..  Of course, all proteinogenic amino acids are important during wound healing. There is evidence that some amino acids are especially important for the process. Methionine and cysteine are involved in the synthesis of connective tissue and collagen. Arginine is thought to have a major influence on the proliferation of collagen accretion and on an improved immune reaction....And of course there is an increased need for fatty acids, vitamin C, iron, zinc etc. From a surgeon's perspective these points need to be considered:...  The metabolic effects of fasting and surgery:.  - fasting rapidly affects metabolism, although gradually adaptation occurs to minimize protein losses.  -  surgery increases metabolic rate and catabolism, of which insulin resistance is related to the magnitude of surgery.  -  insulin treatment in insulin-resistant patients after surgery or trauma markedly improves body metabolism and reduces morbidity and mortality.  -  avoiding preoperative fasting reduces postoperative insulin resistance by about 50% and attenuates postoperative impairment in nitrogen losses, lean body mass and muscle function.  -  fasting or deficient energy intake after surgery does not affect postoperative insulin resistance but does accelerate nitrogen losses.  -  perioperative parenteral nutrition has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with malnutrition, but has no beneficial effects in well fed patients.  -  oral supplements perioperatively may attenuate postoperative weight loss and reduce infectious complications.  -  patients undergoing surgery within a multimodal programme designed to reduce stress and to improve postoperative function display only minor insulin resistance, which allows feeding without hyperglycaemia.....For a more comprehensive view of nutrition and wound healing, take a look at...  Nutrition, Anabolism, and the Wound Healing Process: An Overview:.  One is activation of the stress response to injury, and the second is the development of any protein-energy malnutrition (PEM). Any significant wound leads to a hypermetabolic and catabolic state, and nutritional needs are significantly increased. The healing wound depends on adequate nutrient flow. Of particular concern is the presence of any PEM, PEM being defined as a deficiency of energy and protein intake to meet bodily demands. PEM in the presence of a wound leads to the loss of lean body mass (LBM) or protein stores, which will in and of itself impede the healing process. Early aggressive nutrient and micronutritional feeding is essential to control and prevent this process from developing.

Life, Liberty and Freedom can be mutually exclusive. For a few months you will have to give up Freedom to save Life. China did do that and appears to have succeeded today. What will history say about YOU?....March 16, 2020 Update..Today Canada announced closing borders to all foreign nationals except US citizens. What would China do?...About two weeks ago the border to Washington state would have been sealed off..Because people there flow into B.C. the Alberta / BC border would have been sealed off....What to do today to mimic China?...100 million people live beside the US / Canada border. They like to make day trips to mimic currency arbitrage and buy goods cheaper in other country. This traffic should be shut down..Canadian health care is free, Americans in past have utilized that system, that should be shut down..Everyone crossing border by land should be subject to 5 second forehead temperature check with $60 gun.

They can manage their own laws and have to worry about keeping outsiders out of both towns....China succeeded at first locking down Wuhan City and then Hubie province. Italy tried that and failed. Canada / US appears headed for even bigger failure thinking it will save the economy. Perhaps it will in the short term but more long term planning is still needed:...Airlines will ask for bailouts. Tell them to go bankrupt and create new startups in a couple of years..Edmonton schools are closing for six months. Send teachers out to work for four months even if it is sanitizing buses. After all you are making parents leave work to child care and still expect them to pay 12 months of school taxes right?.It\\'s proposed to pay people unemployment. $800 every two weeks might be fine for 80% of the population but an airline pilot can\\'t live on that if his mortgage and car payments are more than that per month.

Makes me think it is swimming pool and wonders why they refuse to say?.Border closing by Canada and saying 14 self-isolation for all arriving (EXCEPT US CITIZENS who are immune to SARS 2.0 apparently) me they are math challenged. worldometers.com states some claim incubation period of 2 to 14 days with 5.2 days mean time which is what they are getting 14 from. Others say 0 to 28 days but that isn\\'t the point. They should have said if you are arrived from Italy, Egypt, France, Germany, Washington State, Cruise Ship or blah blah 13 days ago then self isolate for 1 day, if 12 days ago then self isolate for 2 days, etc etc up to today arrivals isolate for 14 days..No mention if doctors will be trained how to read CT scan of lungs..No mention if blood test to measure SARS 2.0 anti-bodies will be done. Criminal negligence almost not learning what China learned and shared with the world..Also consider giving bus drivers temperature guns so I can get my temperature checked twice a day too and self-isolate if necessary. Then call dispatch for mini-bus making circles picking feverish people up to pick them up. Travel by planes offer and border crossings offer great chances to take 5 second temperature check but you need to think out of the box sometimes. Research a few weeks ago revealed only 100 ICU beds in Edmonton and Ventilators can\\'t be ordered over night but temperature guns can be ordered over night....They warned us weeks ago to get 14 day supply and I did. Today Doug Ford of Ontario told people to stop buying and \"hoarding\". Make up your mind......Final thoughts for what China would do?..They would lift sanctions against the people of Syria and Iran who suffered enough already in USA bid to cause social unrest due to mass human suffering...Indeed sanctions against Iran and Syria in the first place, China would have voted down if such a measure was introduced in the United Nations Security Council. We can only imagine how decapitated the hospitals in Northern parts of Syria are now with White Helmets running amok to make Oscar award winning videos backed by the guns of ISIS. Witnessing the lies of test kits and extrapolating to other lies like White Helmets things begin to make sense. Would you like a cup of Karma with your reality check?..Crisis can be an opportunity for change and we can watch how China handles it and hopefully treat them as a three month indication to the future of Covidi-9...RT reported that China sent medical experts and supplies to Italy after the EU denied support...Edmonton closed schools today but high school kids were still traveling in buses and associating in groups. It does little good to close schools and still allow kids to associate. China locked down homes and anyone traveling had to produce national ID cards. There are no national ID cards in Canada, my only cards are a debit card and library card (closed in Edmonton as of today). I also carry a bus pass which might have limited value starting tomorrow.....OP\\'s valid question what did China do is almost totally ignored by the Media here whilst USA tries to steal vaccines from other nations to make a fast buck for Trump. Lets make this clear if and when a vaccine is create dit belongs to BSC (Bat Sourced Coronavirus) owner in China who gives it away to the world for free. No patents. No arguments. That said SARS 1.0 vaccine was 13 years in the making before being scrapped in 2016. The world has to stop focusing on maybe\\'s and deal with reality that changes by the hour and is unique to every region and the resources they have in play...This reminds me of Inventory Control training at work where last week he had to reverse adjustments to stock so this week he has to do the same thing for a different SKU. WRONG. It\\'s on a case by case basis and every case is different. Open your universities 24/7 to develop a vaccine and analyze all those drive through test samples sure. Closing them is about the worst thing you could have done with available resources.....Where are the flight manifests of everyone who arrived from Italy, Germany and the Netherlands over the last 30 days? Were they given to the city of Edmonton Police? Real judges have subpoena powers. It\\'s great you closed BS family court with he-said she-said soap opera now lets get the real judges and real law enforcement working. Politicians with silver spoons including Trudeau &amp; Trump have no idea of how the real world works...China and Korea (both Republic and Democratic sides) seem to have their act together.

Trump saw a picture of him photo-shopped image playing the violin and tweeted he likes it whilst completely oblivious to the reference \"Nero fiddled while Rome burned\". The media is devoting too much attention to politicians and not doing investigative journalism. Four words; Fifteen Minute Blood Test. Since you have ten fingers three more; Border Temperature Checks...What would China do?..I imagine by now they would have tracked down all the people that have been to \"Life Care\" (Oxymoron) nursing home in Washington USA and Lynn Valley nursing home in North Vancouver, Canada (been there seen that). No word on if USA and Canada have done that yet???..Also no word from investigative journalists interviewing \"health care professionals\" on if they travel between nursing homes because they are \"specialists\"?..Finally on Saturday March 14, 2020 Apple closed all it\\'s stores outside of China and reopened them inside China. I visited West Edmonton Mall and sure enough the store was closed with 4 blue t-shirt clad employees outside closed doors and I said \"So it\\'s true\" (what Tim Cook said). Investigative journalists be asking themselves what Tech companies knew before their governments did. Look how Facebook and Google closed down events a week or fortnight before your governments did. Ask yourself the 5W\\'s and sometimes how?....March 17, 2020..Happy St. Patrick\\'s Day.

It is used as an oxidizer, bleaching agent, and antiseptic. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide is a reactive oxygen species and has been used as a propellant in rocketry. Its chemistry is dominated by the nature of its unstable peroxide bond.......1: Use of H2O2 in dentistry..This paper is a review of the use of hydrogen peroxide in dentistry. ..The levels of H2O2 in toothpastes and dentifrices are generally much lower than those used for teeth whitening or bleaching....  Studies in which 3% H2O2 or less were used daily for up to 6 years.  showed occasional transitory irritant effects only in a small number.  of subjects with preexisting ulceration, or when high levels of salt.  solutions were concurrently administered. .  .  In contrast, bleaching.  agents that employ or generate high levels of H2O2  or organic.  peroxides can produce localized oral toxicity following sustained.  exposure if mishandled....They note potential health concerns raised by animal studies....  From a single study using the hamster cheek pouch model, 30% H2O2 was.  referred to as a cocarcinogen in the oral mucosa. This (and later).  studies have shown that at 3% or less, no cocarcinogenic activity or.  adverse effects were observed in the hamster cheek pouch following.  lengthy exposure to H2O2....So concentrations below 3% seem unlikely to cause significant harm. Beneficial effects (such as improvement in gingival disease and promoting healing due to an antimicrobial effect) are seen at concentrations above 1%...Based on this, a window of 1-3% concentration of H2O2 would appear to be optimal.....A UK government toxicological report confirms that H2O2 only causes local toxicity by irritation and cellular damage, but it does not cause systemic problems and is not considered a carcinogen.....2: Metabolism of H2O2..H2O2 is a byproduct of many biochemical reactions and is toxic to cells. The enzyme catalase is found in nearly all living organisms exposed to oxygen (such as bacteria, plants, and animals). It catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. It is a very important enzyme in protecting the cell from oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS). These are also known as free radicals...The reaction is shown below......  The toxicity of H2O2 is due to oxidation of proteins, membrane lipids.  and DNA by the peroxide ions. The class of biological enzymes called.  superoxide dismutase (SOD) is developed in nearly all living cells as.  an important antioxidant agent. They promote the disproportionation of.  superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, which is then rapidly.  decomposed by catalase to oxygen and water....What is oxidation?..Oxidation is one of a pair of opposite chemical reactions involving transfer of electrons; oxidation and reduction. Together they are known as redox reactions...Oxidation is the loss of electrons or an increase in the oxidation state of an atom by another atom, an ion, or a molecule...Reduction is the gain of electrons or a decrease in the oxidation state of an atom by another atom, an ion, or a molecule...In a redox reaction, one component is oxidised and the other reduced....  For example, during the combustion of wood, electrons are transferred.  from carbon atoms in the wood to oxygen atoms in the air. The oxygen.  atoms undergo reduction, gaining electrons, while the carbon atoms.  undergo oxidation, losing electrons. Thus oxygen is the oxidizing.  agent and carbon is the reducing agent in this reaction....Another example of a redox reaction is the oxidation of glucose to release energy in cellular respiration...Catalase uses the oxidising power of H2O2 to oxidise other potentially harmful substrates that need to be broken down (like phenols, formic acid, formaldehyde, and alcohol), while the H2O2 itself is reduced in the process. This is called the peroxidation reaction...Catalase is present in all cells (especially the liver and kidneys). Apart from local tissue destruction, small amounts that might be absorbed would be broken down in this manner.....3: Vitiligo..Vitiligo is a condition in which melanocytes in patches of skin cease production of the pigment melanin...There are several theories about its pathogenesis. It is associated with certain genetic susceptibility markers and also with other autoimmune disorders, suggesting an autoimmune process. The autoantigen is likely to be the tyrosinase enzyme, which is involved in melanin biosynthesis...Oxidative stress theory..This research paper discusses oxidative stress in the context of vitiligo....  In vitiligo, melanocytes are particularly vulnerable to oxidative.  stress owing to the pro-oxidant state generated during melanin.  synthesis and to the genetic antioxidant defects....In particular, with relevance to catalase:...  In both lesional and non-lesional skin of vitiligo patients, increased.  levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were observed, accompanied.  with reduced levels and activity of catalase..  .  It is well known that normal melanocytes are vulnerable to excessive.  reactive oxygen species (ROS) for their specialized function of melanin synthesis, which would.  result in a highly pro-oxidant state in the epidermis..  .  This imbalance between the pro-oxidants and the antioxidant status can.  disrupt the homeostasis of melanocytes, causing accumulation of.  oxidized and damaged proteins or organelles, and consequently lead to.  the destruction of melanocytes....So there is evidence of increased oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. However, it is a complex picture, with probable environmental triggers and genetic susceptibility factors. An autoimmune process and oxidative stress are not mutually exclusive, as the former could disable the cellular mechanisms for dealing with the latter.....4: Can absorbed hydrogen peroxide contribute to the pathogenesis of vitiligo due to an increase in oxidative stress?..Essentially, assimilating this information, the answer seems to be no...Applied hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) primarily causes local irritation and tissue damage, depending on the concentration. It is not significantly absorbed and small absorbed amounts would be quickly broken down by catalase...While increased susceptibility to oxidative stress in melanocytes plays a role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo, it is a disruption of the cellular mechanisms for managing oxidative stress, rather than a primary increase of oxidants (like hydrogen peroxide) that is the main factor..', 'wrong_answer_type': 'Random', 'url': 'health.stackexchange.com', 'source': 'biomedical'}",

I will attempt to narrow down the possibilities based on size, appearance and presence or absence of pain...Pain is a significant symptom, and clustering of the lesions is important as well...Benign facial growths (such as warts, seborrheic keratoses, moles, basal cell carcinomas, cherry angiomas, dermatofibromas, etc., are not fluid-filled, nor painful, so need not be discussed. ..Pre-malignant or malignant skin lesions are also solid, not fluid filled or usually painful...Bacterial skin infections (acne, abscesses, etc.) are inflammatory, and present as painful, tender areas of swelling and commonly redness, but do not present as clear fluid-filled lesions. Pus may be present with a bacterial skin infection, but pus is white or off white, sometimes blood tinged, not clear. The exception is discussed below...This leaves blister-like lesions of the face. What are possible causes of blisters on the face? Emphasis will be on the face and small blisters or grouped vesicles. There is a difference between a blister (usually larger than .5 cm) and a vesicle (.1-.4 cm). Also, vesicles can occur singly or in clusters in the same lesion. A cluster of vesicles in the same area may appear to be a blister. They are different...Varicella Zoster Virus..Before vaccinations became available, the most common cause of blisters on the face was chicken pox. Almost 100% of an unvaccinated population contracts this virus (Varicella Zoster Virus or VZV) at some point in life. While chicken pox is still quite common in many parts of the world, the incidence has fallen considerably in countries routinely vaccinating their young...The lesions of chicken pox are probably familiar to most adults: multiple small (less than .5 cm) scattered red papules (small bumps on the skin), clear vesicles on a red base, or small crusted lesions on a red base (initially just the papules, followed by lesions in each stage) scattered  all over the body. These lesions are very itchy...Since VZV infects spinal nerves and lies dormant in the body after chicken pox infection, reactivation (called shingles or herpes zoster) is possible. Like chicken pox, the lesions are clear fluid filled small blisters (called vesicles) on a red base. Unlike chicken pox, reactivation most commonly occurs only in one nerve root at a time, on one side of the body, in the skin which that nerve serves, called a dermatome. Also, the lesions tend to be painful (sometimes very much so), and the skin can be exquisitely sensitive...The trunk of the body is the most common area to be affected, but the face is commonly affected as well...The clear fluid from a ruptured vesicle contains live viruses, therefore attention should be directed to avoid infecting others...Contact or Allergic Dermatitis..Contact with certain chemicals can cause blistering of the skin. Industrial strength cleaners, harsh alkaline substances, etc. can cause painful blistering and redness that looks like a second degree burn of the skin. The source of such chemical burns is usually obvious, as the substance irritates the skin on or very closely after contact. The lesions are usually painful and feel like burns. Treatment is similar to that of burns...A common allergen causing blistering is urushiol, the active organic compound that in  poison ivy that causes a form of contact dermatitis. With sufficient contact, an itchy, red, vesicular rash will appear after several days where contact has occurred, accompanied by itching. The lesions caused by poison ivy often tend to be linear (caused by rubbing along the edge of the leaf) or diffuse (on the hands) if one has been handling poison ivy. If handling the plant, and accidentally touching the face or other body part, urushiol can be transferred to the face as well. The diagnosis is made by the appearance, the distribution of the rash, the characteristic itchiness without pain, and the history of outdoor potential exposure. ..Impetigo..Impetigo is a skin infection most commonly involving young children, but  it is highly infectious, adult close contacts may be affected. There are two types. Nonbullous impetigo starts as as painless or possibly itchy single papule that progresses to a vesicle. The vesicle ruptures, and the lesion secretes clear fluid that forms the typical honey-colored crust. As the fluid is infectious, the lesion grows in diameter, and new lesions appear near to the initial one. It is commonly found near the nose or mouth, but can occur anywhere on the face/exposed areas of the body...Bullous impetigo forms small to large, soft blisters which break easily. It is not particularly painful although it can resemble a superficial second-degree burn. Bullous impetigo is not common on the face, rather it seems to occur more commonly in moist areas, such as the diaper area (in infants), the underarms, and neck folds...Herpes Simplex Virus..Once infected with Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), the virus, like VZV, lives in sensory nerve ganglia. There are two types of HSV, Types 1 and 2. HSV-1 is the common cause of cold sores or \"fever blisters\", but in fact can infect and recur on any part of the body. HSV-2 is the most common cause of genital herpes. Both viruses are spread by direct contact, so any skin/mucosal membranes directly exposed to either HSV-1 or HSV-2 can become infected, with recurrences common. HSV-1 infection, though it is with the same virus, can have different names depending on the area infected: Herpes labialis (lips), sacral herpes (on back near buttocks), herpetic whitlow (fingers), Herpes gladiatorum (aka \\'mat herpes\\', initially diagnosed in wrestlers with close skin-to-skin contact), etc. Herpes Simplex Virus infections can occur anywhere on the body...HSV, since it infects sensory nerves, is characterized by a period of pain or tingling preceding and accompanying the outbreak of clustered small vesicles - often more than one cluster - on a swollen, sometimes red base. The first outbreak is usually the most dramatic, but it may be minor and overlooked.

One form may be a blister. This is called a Bullous fixed drug eruption. Symptoms may include itching, burning, and/or pain. There usually isn\\'t pain preceding the eruption....  Initially, a single lesion or a few lesions develop, but, with re-exposure, additional lesions occur. The vast majority of patients present with 1-30 lesions, ranging in size of 0.5-5 cm, but reports of lesions greater than 10 cm have been published. Lesions may be generalized. The most common reported site is the lips, and these may be seen in up to half of all cases. ...The initial lesion can be a vesicle or small blister.

Each of them has manufacturer instuctions that list their test results towards the end. Some of the submitted test results use ≈100 negative samples in the clinical evaluation. But there is also one that has only 13 positive cases (all of which were correctly found) in their test - but that one got the emergency approval already early in February..The latest 2 (by Thermo and Roche) used 60/60 and 50/100 cases for their clinical evaluation (all results correct). That gets the lower end of the confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity to 94 - 97 % (with the lower end of the c.i. we\\'d thus have LR+ >≈ 20 or 17, expected values would be 61 or 51, respectively. For LR- &lt;≈ 1/20 or 1/32 (expected 1/61 or 1/100). ....Long version: Let\\'s do some number juggling and see whether we can extract something useful. The following calculations are based on a somewhat worst-case scenario: the FDA emergency validation guidelines specify outcomes that such a new test in the current emergency situation must meet, and I calculate from the low end of performance that could be expected meet these criteria under somewhat unlucky circumstances...So we know minimum performance requirements, but I do not know [yet] how good (= how much better than minimum performance) the tests are...Sensitivity and Specificity..The starting point would be sensitivity and specificity of the respective test.  I haven\\'t found any published data on these, but the FDA has a Policy for Diagnostics Testing for Coronavirus Disease-2019 that says how labs that develop a test should do an \"emergency validation\". They can then get Emergency Use Approval.  ...Sensitivity tells us: of all truly Covid-19-positive specimen, which percentage is correctly recognized as positive by the test; I\\'m going to use  87.5 % (see below).Specificity tells us: of all specimen that are truly negative for Covid-19, which percentage is correctly recognized by the test....Sensitivity and specificity can be measured by standardized protocols, and they characterize the performance of the test. ..From a patient\\'s or doctor\\'s point of view, however, they are not very useful numbers as they (we) need the answer to the inverse questions:..Predictive values...positive predictive value PPV: given that the test yielded positive, what is the probability that the patient truly has the virus?.negative predictive value NPV: given that the test yielded negative, what is the probability that the patient truly does not have the virus?...Predictive values can be calculated from sensitivity and specificity together with the prevalence (or, as we are talking about newly infected patients, the incidence) of virus among the tested population. Here\\'s how they go for the assumed sensitivity and specificity:...red for positive test outcomes, dark green for negative test outcomes. posterior probability = after the test said something, what is the probability that the test result is correct = NPV for negative test result, PPV for positive test result...Good estimates of prevalence are often difficult to obtain, because we need the prevalence among those who are tested and that is (and should be) quite different from the prevalence of the disease in the general population. ..For some countries such as Italy, we have numbers of performed tests (Wiki page giving numbers for more countries): as of today (March 14th), they ran 109170 tests and have a total of 21157 cases. Not all tests are for initial diagnosis (AFAIK, a patient is considered cured only after a bunch of tests are negative), but as most cases are still \"fresh\", we may the ratio positive cases : tests run as one surrogate for the prevalence in the tested population. This would be around 20 % for Italy. ..From the diagram we can then read for a new patient being tested the first time:...if the test outcome is positive, chances are ≈ 75 % (or greater as I\\'m calcluating with the lower end of the possible range from the emergency validation) that the patient really has Covid-19..So, up to 25 % false positives. .if the test outcome is negative, chances are ≈ 95 % (or greater...) that the patient really does not have Covid-19..So, up to 5 % false negatives. ...Canada currently reports 25 positive out of a total of 796 tests, so about 3 % prevalence in the tested population...For the USA, the CDC reports case numbers and test numbers, currently 1629 cases with (3995 + 15749) tests - but it is not entirely clear to me whether the populations completely coincide. Anyways, I\\'ll use 8 % as guesstimate for prevalence...| prevalence |  PPV |    NPV | Country/Population | .+------------+------+--------+--------------------+.| 3 %        | 26 % | 99.6 % | Canada             |.| 8-9 % (?)  | 50 % | 98.8 % | USA, Germany       |.| 20 %       | 75 % | 95   % | Italy              |....Now that is the population of \"everyone who is tested\". At least for Germany (March 14th) but probably also for Canada and the US, tests are done on people who show symptoms and on people that are known to have had contact with Corona virus cases: if they are found to be positive, they are sent home to quarantine and wait whether they did acutally catch the disease. But we may still say that the \"people who are tested\" population has subpopulations with and without symptoms..So if there are further point of suspicion, say, the patient does cough, we\\'d say they belong to a high risk subpopulation with higher prevalence of Covid-19 compared to the overall prevalence among tested, so the chance of a false positive would be lower for them.  ..This will change as tests are performed only on people who show symptoms (by now, March 16th, everyone is already  told to stay at home in Germany and self-isolate as well as possible - the test result will not change this in any way).  ..Handy for quick calculation: likelihood ratio positive (LR+) and negative (LR-)..If we express the prevalence as odds (1 : 99 instead of 1 %), LR+ and LR- allow easy back-of-the envelope calculations. ..LR+ = sensitivity / (1 - specificity) ≈ 11 or better for our test and .LR- = (1 - sensitivity) / specificity ≈ 0.05 = 1/20 or better for our test...so they are indpendent of the prevalence and they tell us how the odds change due to the test: the posterior probability (predictive values) are the the pre-test odds multiplied with the likelihood ratio. In that sense, they tell us how much information we gain due to test (for positive and negative outcomes)...So, Canada reported odds of 25 positive : 771 negative tests. So for Sophie Trudeau, the odds went from 25 : 771 (or 3 %) to  25 : 771 * 11 = 273 : 771 ≈ 1 : 3 or 25 %. For Justin Trudeau 25 : 771 / 20 = 25 : 15420 ≈ 1 : 617 or 0.16 % of being Covid-19 positive (slight discrepancy to above due to rounding)...On the other hand, if we start testing more and more people for whom the risk of actcually having contracted the virus is lower and lower, we soon won\\'t be able to draw meaningful conclusions from the test results any more: I\\'m in Germany, currently the federal info page lists 3800 confirmed cases. Even if we assume that there is a huge dark figure and in reality 20 x as many people are infected* that would be a prevalence in the general population of 0.1 %, the odds are 1 infected : 1.5 mio non-infected. If someone who does not belong to any particular risk group were tested positive, their odds would increase by factor 11, i.e. roughly 1 : 140000. A negative test result would decrease the odds by a factor of 1/20 to 1 : 31 mio. However, both results are of no practical use as they don\\'t change the situation: pre-test situation is \"very unlikely to be Covid-19 case\", post-test situation is still \"very unlikely to be Covid-19 case\"...This is why, even if there were testing capacities for the whole population, tests don\\'t make sense unless we know there are some risk factors such as some kind of respiratory disease or contact to someone who is known to have the virus. And why it is sensible to say that on slightly suspicious circumstances (= low, but not extremely low prevalence), one should self-quarantine/avoid contact but there\\'s no point in testing\\xa0[yet].....Detais on how I estimate sensitivity and specificity...The lab first determines the limit of detection (LoD) for virus RNA. The LoD here is the lowest concentration at which 19 out of 20 replicate tests are positive (that would be 95 % sensitivity, but for samples spiked in the lab, but with a relevant and as difficult as possible matrix such as sputum). .Next, [leftover] clinical samples are used: ...As there may not be any positive samples available, the lab can spike negative samples with virus RNA; a minimum of 20 samples are spiked within a range of 1 - 2 LoD plus 10 samples to cover the remaining clinical range..Of these, at most 1 is allowed to have negative outcome (and that must be one in the lower concentration range). Thus, 29 positive out of 30 true positive. .Also 30 non-reactive specimens are tested. The policy doesn\\'t say a number of false positives that is permissible, so I\\'m going to assume that must be zero.  ..The lab can then start with real patient samples. The first 5 positive and the first 5 negative cases must be confirmed by an approved test (and must all match). ...Pooling the 2 \"rounds\" of testing clinical samples, we have:...34 (or 35) positive tests out of 35 truly positive specimen -> sensitivity at least 97 % with 95% credible interval 87.5 - 100 %,.specficity 100 % with 95% credible interval 92 - 100 %.There are additional checks required but they don\\'t help us here..Sampling errors are not included in this validation..I\\'m not a clinical chemist, but I\\'m analytical chemist and in general analytical chemistry, that can easily be the dominating source of error. In that case, the above numbers would be useless..Particularly the sensitivity may drop over time as the virus mutates. .To deal with this, in some cases multiple tests are done (read that in some newspaper article which I don\\'t find at the moment)..When doing multiple tests, tests by different providers are used if possible: as they are developed from different virus samples, this gives a better coverage for mutations in the virus than doing the same test in replicate......* Very handwavy scenario I derived from the development of case numbers in China after their quarantine/shutdown on Jan 26, assuming an incubation period of 2 weeks and that noone got infected after quarantine started..', 'answer_type': 'Accepted', 'wrong_answer': \"Basically, the signal transduction pathway of PGI2 involves a Gs protein.

Why does soap work so well on the Sars-CoV-2, the coronavirus and.  indeed most viruses? The short story: because the virus is a.  self-assembled nanoparticle in which the weakest link is the lipid.  (fatty) bilayer. Soap dissolves the fat membrane and the virus falls.  apart like a house of cards and dies – or rather, we should say it.  becomes inactive as viruses aren’t really alive..  .  The slightly longer story is that most viruses consist of three key.  building blocks: ribonucleic acid (RNA), proteins and lipids. A.  virus-infected cell makes lots of these building blocks, which then.  spontaneously self-assemble to form the virus. Critically, there are.  no strong covalent bonds holding these units together, which means you.  do not necessarily need harsh chemicals to split those units apart..  When an infected cell dies, all these new viruses escape and go on to.  infect other cells. Some end up also in the airways of lungs..  .  When you cough, or especially when you sneeze, tiny droplets from the.  airways can fly up to 10 metres. The larger ones are thought to be the.  main coronavirus carriers and they can go at least two metres..  .  These tiny droplets end on surfaces and often dry out quickly. But the.  viruses remain active. Human skin is an ideal surface for a virus. It.  is “organic” and the proteins and fatty acids in the dead cells on the.  surface interact with the virus..  .  When you touch, say, a steel surface with a virus particle on it, it.  will stick to your skin and hence get transferred on to your hands. If.  you then touch your face, especially your eyes, nostrils or mouth, you.  can get infected. And it turns out that most people touch their face.  once every two to five minutes..  .  Washing the virus off with water alone might work. But water is not.  good at competing with the strong, glue-like interactions between the.  skin and the virus. Water isn’t enough..  .  Soapy water is totally different. Soap contains fat-like substances.  known as amphiphiles, some of which are structurally very similar to.  the lipids in the virus membrane. The soap molecules “compete” with.  the lipids in the virus membrane. This is more or less how soap also.  removes normal dirt from the skin..  .  The soap not only loosens the “glue” between the virus and the skin.  but also the Velcro-like interactions that hold the proteins, lipids.  and RNA in the virus together..  .  Alcohol-based products, which pretty much includes all “disinfectant”.  products, contain a high-percentage alcohol solution (typically 60-80%.  ethanol) and kill viruses in a similar fashion. But soap is better.  because you only need a fairly small amount of soapy water, which,.  with rubbing, covers your entire hand easily. Whereas you need to.  literally soak the virus in ethanol for a brief moment, and wipes or.  rubbing a gel on the hands does not guarantee that you soak every.  corner of the skin on your hands effectively enough..  .

Or does in mean that vaccine doesn\\'t stop the spread as much as it really stops the disease?...That can also happen. Of course, the best and intended outcome of vaccination is that the acquired immunity is sufficient to prevent infection. Which means that the vaccinated person cannot spread the disease.

E.g. even with varicella vaccination 10 - 30 % of the exposed to get chickenpox (but even with them, serious disease is avoided). ..For the flu, the difficulty is that new strains appear regularly. This is also the reason why flu vaccination is done annually with a newly developed vaccine while e.g. for MMRV, pertussis, polio boosting with the existing vaccine every 10 years is sufficient (immunity actually may last even longer, up to lifelong*, but that varies by person, and since many vaccines haven\\'t been around that long, we don\\'t know for which that is the case).

It appears most beneficial to stay hydrated throughout the day and if you must drink while you eat, avoid drinking too much, as well as alcohol and acidic drinks.

Looking at the current (Mar 19) numbers of positive tests among all tests (Germany) and using LR+ of better than 20  (below in parentheses)and expected 61 and LR- of better than 1/20 (below in parentheses), expected 1/61 (see long explanation here)..            | pos tests/tests\\xa0| PPV         | 1-NPV.------------+-----------------+-------------+------------------.USA         |          11   % | 88 % (72 %) |  0.2  % (0.6  %) .Germany     |           3.9 % |.South Korea |           2.8 % | 64 % (36 %) |  0.05 % (0.01 %) ...PPV = probability of having SARS-CoV-2 after the test was positive.1-NPV = probability of having SARS-CoV-2 after the test was negative  ..(There\\'s the implicit assumption that everyone is tested with that same test - which is not true, the South Koreans by now may have better validation data, but I don\\'t know this)..Screening means testing the normal population, which (still) has much lower prevalence of SARS-CoV-2.

On the other hand, with prevalence in the single digit percent we\\'d be in the region where Frieden argues that testing of the general population doesn\\'t make sense because it makes more sense to tell people to stay at home and away from contacts (which is the case for Germany - and since the numbers aren\\'t growing as fast in South Korea, their dark number is probably much lower). ..In the low risk population (where Frieden says testing would make sense), we\\'d have only correct 1 out of about 200 positive cases. The PPV is for many practical considerations too low: screening needs very good tests, with very high sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity, because it is crucial here not to overlook truly positive cases, and specificity because the true positives  are otherwise hidden in army of false positives. ..To some extent, it is often possible to trade in some sensitivity for speificity and vice versa, e.g. with HIV test for blood donors, we do exactly this: we choose a very high sensitivity (so we can be sure not to infect anyone), and accept low specificity. So low, that a blood donor with positive HIV test isn\\'t even told that they were tested positive. Instead, another test is applied (preferably by another manufacturer, because that adds more information than duplicate testing with the same kit), and if that is still positive, yet another one (a more elaborate one). After that IIRC it is still more probable that the blood donor does not have HIV, but they\\'s be looking into it and taking anothe blood sample. .(And the decision for the donated blood is anyways to throw it away just to be on the safe side). ..In principle we could do the same for SARS-CoV-2. Chaining lab tests would mean an enormous burden to the health system of dealing with false positives (and possibly re-testing people) at a time where we don\\'t have unlimited health resources and where the probability that the false positive anyways catches the virus next day or so is non-negligible. This makes this strategy that starts from testing low risk population a complete waste of ressources (even if we had unlimited capacity for testing). This may change in the future when we have tests where proper full validation has shown that they have very good specificity and a useful sensitivity...What we do currently, isn\\'t very different though in principle:.We do currently chain two independent tests, just that the lab test comes 2nd: first a doctor comes and tests whether you are high risk group because you had contact with confirmed cases (maybe even 2nd order contacts) or you show symptoms. Then comes the lab test. ..Now the Germany* line in the table above is an interesting additional point. The prevalence there is from the influenza sentinel data from week 11 (last week). These are samples collected from people who were not sent to SARS-CoV-2 tests, but who went to a doctor with flu-like symptoms. 1 out of 251 was SARS-CoV-2 positive (and also influenza positive). The practically important point is: what did we miss because that SARS-CoV-2 case was overlooked (or would have been, had they not been in the sentinel sampling)? Actually, nothing: someone with the flu is told to stay at home and not infect anyone else pretty much like someone with SARS-CoV-2 (particularly now since it would also relieve the health system if the seasonal influenza would be overcome a bit faster). ..Testing in areas with few infections..Frieden does not propose screening, though: he proposes testing people who have been in contact with infected ones. Which apparently did not work out in Seattle, from what I read due to a lack of tests - but it did work out in Germany where it allowed to completely stop the first (small) outbreak in January...Here, the \"had (2nd order) contact to infected person\" is the first test in the chain. This is a containment strategy, not a delay strategy. ..In order for this to work, we need a two \"ingredients\": we must be able to trace the contacts (and better also 2nd order contacts), and people sent to quarantine must obey this quarantine. ..Comparison Germany - South Korea (mainly)..... the US is left as excercise to the informed reader...South Korea apparently makes extensive use of autamated tracing of people in a fashion that would be completely unconstitutional in Germany.  .South Korea does use social distancing: according to Wikipedia they also shut down kindergardens, schools, and universities postponed their semester start. It did not have quite the same impact on overall economy that we see in Germany now.

(Didn\\'t find testing numbers, though).Norway has 6440 tests/mio inhabitants. Hopeful look at curve suggests that a slight flattening may take place. They started their lockdown at ≈700 cases, a bit more than a week ago..Germany has ≈2100 tests/mio. 100 k tests were done in week 11, current capacity is about 30 k tests/day (is currently ramping up)..(substantial flattening at the earliest expected in about 2 weeks).USA: according to Wikipedia 300 / mio inhabitants, but the German newspaper cites 3.5x as many tests, that would be 1100 / mio inhabitants..(The difference may be whether private lab tests are counted or not?)...The Dutch test..... is about antibodies whereas the other tests look for virus RNA.

One should not confuse raging passions for getting a raging clue. This is not a trivial point:...  The Subjective Sexual Arousal Scale for Men (SSASM): Preliminary Development and Psychometric Validation of a Multidimensional Measure of Subjective Male Sexual Arousal .  .  Male sexual arousal has been historically.  described as a central physiological state, with.  penile erection in a sexual context as its most valid.  objective measure [21]. Bancroft deﬁnes sexual.  arousal as a state that is motivated toward experi-.  encing sexual pleasure and possibly orgasm, which.  involves the processing of relevant stimuli, general.  arousal, incentive motivation, and genital response.  [22]. A multifaceted process of male sexual arousal.  is supported by functional magnetic resonance.  imaging data indicating different patterns of brain.  stimulation during sexual arousal, penile tumes-.  cence, and penile erection in healthy male volun-.  teers [23]. Furthermore, studies in men without.  sexual dysfunction have demonstrated that penile.  erection is not always highly associated with sub-.  jective mental aspects of sexual arousal [24,25]..  Based on these ﬁndings, a lack of subjective sexual.  arousal may explain why some men with ED fail to.  respond to treatment with PDE5 inhibitors.  despite having the physiological ability to achieve.  and maintain an erection....However, my reference to the role of exogenous testosterone may more accurately reflect what is meant by \"libido\" or sexual desire...Exogenous testosterone..Alternatively, you might have some measure of sexual interest in males, in which case administration of exogenous testosterone displays efficacy in this regard:...  The effects of exogenous testosterone on sexuality and mood of normal men .  .  The effects of supraphysiological levels of testosterone, used for male contraception, on sexual behavior and mood were studied in a single-blind, placebo-controlled manner in a group of 31 normal men. After 4 weeks of baseline observations, the men were randomized into two groups: one group received 200 mg testosterone enanthate (TE) weekly by im injection for 8 weeks (Testosterone Only group), the other received placebo injections once weekly for the first 4 weeks followed by TE 200 mg weekly for the following 4 weeks (Placebo/Testosterone group). The testosterone administration increased trough plasma testosterone levels by 80%, compatible with peak testosterone levels 400-500% above baseline. Various aspects of sexuality were assessed using sexuality experience scales (SES) questionnaires at the end of each 4-week period while sexual activity and mood states were recorded by daily dairies and self-rating scales. In both groups there was a significant increase in scores in the Psychosexual Stimulation Scale of the SES (i.e. SES 2) following testosterone administration, but not with placebo. There were no changes in SES 3, which measures aspects of sexual interaction with the partner. In both groups there were no changes in frequency of sexual intercourse, masturbation, or penile erection on waking nor in any of the moods reported. The Placebo/Testosterone group showed an increase in self-reported interest in sex during testosterone treatment but not with placebo. The SES 2 results suggest that sexual awareness and arousability can be increased by supraphysiological levels of testosterone. However, these changes are not reflected in modifications of overt sexual behavior, which in eugonadal men may be more determined by sexual relationship factors. This contrasts with hypogonadal men, in whom testosterone replacement clearly stimulates sexual behavior. There was no evidence to suggest an alteration in any of the mood states studied, in particular those associated with increased aggression. We conclude that supraphysiological levels of testosterone maintained for up to 2 months can promote some aspects of sexual arousability without stimulating sexual activity in eugonadal men within stable heterosexual relationships. Raising testosterone does not increase self-reported ratings of aggressive feelings....If we consider both testosterone and PT-141 in tandem, sexual awareness and sexual arousal can be dissociated from one another...Dopaminergic stimulants e.g. meth/amphetamine..There is some evidence from animal studies to suggest that amphetamine increases libido, as operationalised by frequency of sex.

However, I will need to dig up some references....

Before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, no one had ever heard of the causative agent 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2). There were no approved antivirals or vaccines for this virus or for any related coronaviruses (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus)..  .  Problems with COVID-19 vaccine development.  .  Developing vaccines from scratch—which is required for COVID-19—is typically not a good option for stopping an ongoing pandemic. The extensive time required to develop a safe and effective vaccine that can prevent future disease in vaccine recipients (average of approximately 10 years) [1] means that the public health threat will end long before a candidate vaccine is licensed..  .  Vaccine development requires extensive planning regarding vaccine design, vaccine production and purification, preclinical testing in animals (to ensure some safety in humans), and multiple phases of clinical trials in humans (phase 1 for safety and phases 2 and 3 for efficacy). Companies taking the risk and proceeding with vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 (at least 13 companies as of March 7, 2020) [2] are banking on the virus continuously circulating, so they have a population to conduct phase 2 and 3 trials with. If the virus disappears from circulation in China—or the perceived risk the virus poses to human health substantially declines—before phase 2 trials end, vaccine development will probably end..  .  Vaccine design approaches.  .  Vaccines that are safe and stimulate the right immune responses that confer protection from disease are challenging to design. There are a number of different strategies companies have used: live attenuated or inactivated viruses, virus-like particles or other protein-based approaches, viral vector–\\xadbased vaccines or nucleic acid–based vaccines. Of the potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the pipeline, four involve nonreplicating viruses or protein constructs, four have nucleic acid–based designs, two contain live attenuated viruses and one involves a viral vector [2]. Regarding the previous SARS pandemic, one inactivated SARS-CoV [3] and one DNA-based vaccine [4] made it through phase 1 trials before vaccine development ended..  .  The different approaches for vaccine design all carry different advantages and disadvantages [5]. Approaches involving replicating viruses stimulate robust immune responses, but safety is often a concern. Protein vaccines and nucleic acid–based vaccines are often safer but typically have less immunogenicity, and they require adjustments to induce stronger immune responses. Nucleic acid–based vaccines are typically the fastest to get into phase 1 studies, but no nucleic acid vaccine has been licensed for use in humans as of yet..  .  Because of safety concerns involving older populations (who have higher risk for severe disease), using a live attenuated virus might not be the best approach [6]. Patients with severe disease typically have T-helper 2 responses (immune responses typically induced against extracellular parasites), so vaccines known to elicit this type of immune response (inactivated viruses, virus vectors) might also be best avoided. Vaccines involving protein-based (virus protein subunits, virus-like particles, nanoparticles) or nucleic acid–based (DNA or RNA encoding virus structural proteins) designs, which do not have known safety disadvantages, might be the best approaches for SARS-CoV-2..  .  Unfortunately, our knowledge of the immune response is not advanced enough for us to accurately predict vaccine safety and efficacy. What we have to do (testing multiple different strategies) is exactly what is being done. Only with results from more extensive research will we know the absolute best approaches for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development.\\xa0...Furthermore experts have said that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is heavily glycosalated so that potential immune epitopes are hidden from the immune system..', 'answer_type': 'Accepted', 'wrong_answer': \"Assuming the person is not taking anticoagulants, it's actually quite difficult to bleed to death from dismemberment of small members (hands, feet, penis, ears, nose, etc).

For example, transected arteries will spasm and clamp off blood flow, and loss of blood will cause the body to divert blood flow away from the extremities and to the vital organs, thereby slowing the bleeding and allowing it to clot. In fact, the whole shock process can be viewed as a set of defensive measures by the body to ensure survival in the face of serious injury. This was a bitter lesson learned by emergency medicine only fairly recently. The standard practice used to be to infuse hypovolemic patients with fluids to maintain normal blood pressure.

Also, in some cases, quantification of uric acid excretion can help to investigate whether hyperuricemia is due to increased production or reduced excretion...Finally, while in some cases, antihyperuricemia therapy is indicated, routine treatment of hyperuricemia is not recommended..A systematic review (when authours review all the current scientific literature regarding a specific topic/question) conducted in 2014 regarding risk factors for gouty arthritis found following risk factors:...  Alcohol consumption increased the risk of incident gout, especially.  beer and hard liquor. Several dietary factors increased the risk of.  incident gout, including meat intake, seafood intake, sugar sweetened.  soft drinks, and consumption of foods high in fructose. Diary intake,.  folate intake and coffee consumption were each associated with a lower.  risk of incident gout and in some cases a lower rate of gout flares..  Thiazide and loop diuretics were associated with higher risk of.  incident gout and higher rate of gout flares. Hypertension, renal.  insufficiency, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia,.  hyperuricemia, diabetes, obesity and early menopause were each.  associated with a higher risk of incident gout and/or gout flares....So working on these risk factors should reduce the risk of developing hyperuricemia...Sources:...Singh JA, Reddy SG, Kundukulam J.

They require good sensitivity.  ..We\\'re not in a screening situation with the current SARS-CoV-2 testing, and pooling wouldn\\'t help much right now - it would probably not be worth while the effort to develop and implment pooled tests. ....Long version:..(update: deleted newspaper hints that logistics may be the bottleneck:)...  What is the bottle neck in the testign process?...According to Kekulé (10 min or so into the interview) the \"lab machinery\" in Germany has a capacity of several 100k tests per day, but right now there are shortages in reagents but also e.g. in the swabs for taking samples (so, comparably low tech parts of the test). Pooled tests of course need just as many swabs (if not more: false negatives due to the sampling not picking up virus material is a concern, and the usual remedy is to take more swabs.)....Anything that comes now are my guesses as a professional from a neighbouring field: analytical chemistry). I don\\'t have any first hand experience with PCR. ...  Does the amount of material needed to test for COVID-19 scale rather with the number of performed tests, or with the amount of tested material?...I expect the reagent needs to scale (mostly) with the number of performed tests. I also expect the amount of tested material to be the same (prescribed by the method/protocol) for each run. That is, when you pool n samples, you\\'d take only 1/n of material from each (In practice it may be better to pool and then take out 1/n of the pooled sample).  Update: The test described in the newspaper goes the opposite direction: they take n times the sample material in order to avoid trouble with low sensitivity. In consequence, this cannot be considered a \"derived\" \"variety\" of the 1-sample tests, it must be newly developed almost from scratch....  Does the amount of time needed to test for COVID-19 scale rather with the number of performed tests, or with the amount of tested material?...Again: the tests, mor precisely the number of batches of tests since multiple tests can be processed in parallel. ...  Is the the nucleic acid amplification test still reliable enough, if the Virus RNA to be detected is dilluded among multiple samples?...(From here on, we\\'re back inside my professional experience)..This I cannot answer since I don\\'t know the typical concentration range of virus RNA in the samples of positive cases.  ..The lowest concentration of virus RNA that can reliably be detected is called the limit of detection (LoD). In this context, reliably is 19 out of 20 validation samples at that concentration according to the emergency/\"shortcut\" validation procedure of the FDA (I expect other parts of the world to have similar validation procedures right now). The rFDA has a page with tests that have this emergency approval](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations#covid19ivd), and the Manufacturer information lists the LoD. ..One would relate the lower end of the typical concentration range to the LoD to calculate how many samples could be pooled without the test becoming unreliable. .The linked news article hints that this may actually be a limiting factor. The test under development avoids this problem by using more sample material.....There\\'s another limitation to how many samples one can sensibly pool. The aim of the procedure is to save tests. Thus, we need to set up the pooling so that only a small proportion of pooled tests is positive and a large fraction of cases can be \"closed\" as negative. ..Here\\'s the fraction of pooled samples that is positive depending on the prevalence = fraction of positive samples and the number of samples that are pooled n:..  ..Contours are every 10 %points. Dashed and dotted lines are the current fractions of positive samples for Germany and Italy...From that, we can calculate how many samples we need to run (for every positive pooled sample, additional n tests) and from that the fraction of tests we save compared to testing each sample separately:....Contours here are right to left: 0, 25 %, 50 % and 75 % \"savings\"...So, at the current testing situation in Germany, pooling 4 samples would allow to save almost 60 % of tests. In Italy, pooling 3 samples would save less than 15 % of tests...A pooled test would need its own validation and one would also do some additional development to get the required sensitivity (LoD) for the desired number of pooled samples, meaning more delay until pooled tests would be available. ..In addition, pooled tests alongside the single tests that are anyways needed would mean additional logistic burden in the labs.  ..I don\\'t think developing a pooled test would be worth while right now, the more so, as other measures would give similar or better relief:..Doing only 1 test per household would save about 50 % since the average size of a household in Germany is 2 without the need of any new test development...The same is true for further concentrating the tests on the vulnerable/high risk population. ..Thus, pooled tests may help in the containment phase when they\\'d allow to test a larger number of possible contacts. ..Update: Getting back into containment phase is the aim of the current lockdown. ..We\\'d still have high requirements for sensitivity and specificity. This means, pooled tests would have helped most right at the beginning of the epidemic - but they always mean additional R&amp;D and also additional validation needs to be done (and part of the validation work btw. must be done in every single lab that wants to use the test) since they need to be implemented in addition to the single sample method.

Although the mechanism is complicated, the basic idea is that estrogen can bind to the cells in the tumor and make it grow faster. For this reason, people with tumors expressing the estrogen receptor are often treated with hormonal therapy that blocks that hormonal stimulation. In pre-menopausal women, this is usually tamoxifen or a related drug, which blocks the receptors directly. In post-menopausal women, a class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole, etc.) that block estrogen production are used. The important piece to note is that only tumors that express estrogen receptors respond to this type of hormonal treatment...Partly because of the availability of these hormonal treatments, and perhaps partly due to the biology of the tumors themselves, breast cancer that expresses estrogen receptors tends to have a better prognosis than estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. Prognosis can refer to a variety of outcomes; in cancer studies it’s usually either survival or cancer-free survival. Patients with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer tend to fare better than those with estrogen-receptor negative tumors. Another way of stating that is: the presence of the estrogen-receptor has a favorable prognostic significance...The pathology report (if I’ve got the context correct!) is saying that most (80%) of the cells in the specimen expressed the estrogen receptor.

Where they go depends on the local temperatures, humidity and air flows.....The image shows a cough on the left and a sneeze on the right.  ...  Currently, the term droplet is often taken to refer to droplets >5 μm in diameter that fall rapidly to the ground under gravity, and therefore are transmitted only over a limited distance (e.g. ≤1 m). In contrast, the term droplet nuclei refers to droplets ≤5 μm in diameter that can remain suspended in air for significant periods of time, allowing them to be transmitted over distances >1 m (Stetzenbach, Buttner &amp; Cruz, 2004; Wong &amp; Leung, 2004). Other studies suggest slightly different definitions, with ranges for “large” droplets, “small” droplets and droplet nuclei being >60 μm in diameter, ≤60 μm in diameter and &lt;10 μm in diameter, respectively (Tang et al., 2006; Xie et al., 2007). The concept is that the naturally and artificially produced aerosols will contain a range of droplet sizes, whose motion will depend significantly on various environmental factors, such as gravity, the direction and strength of local airflows, temperature and relative humidity (which will affect both the size and mass of the droplet due to evaporation)....Oops, breathing and talking can produce droplets yet health authorities continue to claim that masks are not needed (to stop wearers from broadcasting droplets into the environment)...  Humans can produce respiratory aerosols (droplets) by several means, including breathing, talking, coughing (Figure C.1, A), sneezing (Figure C.1, B) and even singing (Wong, 2003; Toth et al., 2004)....We are being told that the main droplets are the larger ones being emitted but talking for 5 mins can produce droplet nuclei the same as a cough...  Published data have suggested that sneezing may produce as many as 40 000 droplets between 0.5–12 μm in diameter (Cole &amp; Cook, 1998; Tang et al., 2006) that may be expelled at speeds up to 100 m/s (Wells, 1955; Cole &amp; Cook, 1998), whereas coughing may produce up to 3000 droplet nuclei, about the same number as talking for five minutes (Cole &amp; Cook, 1998; Fitzgerald &amp; Haas, 2005; Tang et al., 2006). Despite the variety in size, large droplets comprise most of the total volume of expelled respiratory droplets. Further data on the behaviour of droplet dispersion in naturally generated aerosols are needed....Small droplets fall to the ground where they dry up before they reach the ground but some become droplet nuclei on their way down which allows them to remain airborne...  In the classic study of airborne transmission, Wells (1934) was able to identify the difference between disease transmission via large droplets and by airborne routes. Wells found that, under normal air conditions, droplets smaller than 100 μm in diameter would completely dry out before falling approximately 2 m to the ground. This finding allowed the establishment of the theory of droplets and droplet nuclei transmission depending on the size of the infected droplet. The Wells evaporation-falling curve of droplets (see Figure C.2) is important in understanding airborne transmission and transmission by large droplets. Wells' study also demonstrated that droplets could transform into droplet nuclei by evaporation....And what happens to droplet nuclei...  Droplet nuclei floating on the air may be carried by the movement of air. Entrainment of air into neighbouring airspaces may occur during the most innocuous daily activities; for example, as a result of people walking, or the opening of a door between a room and the adjacent corridor or space (Hayden et al., 1998; Edge, Paterson &amp; Settles, 2005; Tang et al., 2005, 2006). In addition, the air temperature (and therefore air density) differences across an open doorway will also cause air exchange to occur between the two areas, providing a second mechanism to allow air into other areas (Tang et al., 2005, 2006) (see Figure C.3)....which is why they use negative pressure rooms when doing a procedure that can form aerosols..https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143281/.\", 'answer_type': 'Accepted', 'wrong_answer': \"I had never heard about what your cousin refers to.

One possible scenario is that bat coronavirus combined with a fish coronavirus inside the intermediate host.  This is based on the observation that the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene shares a 39-base insertion with a type of soldierfish that swims in the South China Sea...The SARS-CoV-2 infects humans via the ACE2 surface receptor, but this receptor is not only found in humans.  Other animals have similar but not exactly the same ACE2 receptors and several dogs and one cat have returned positive swabs for SARS-CoV-2.  The cat developed covid-19 symptoms.  The first dog died two days after being released back to its owner but that might have been from the stress of quarantine in a 17 year old Pomeranian.

My experience of medical intervention is as follows....As pointed out in the answer to Does taking antibiotics make you immune to virus? antibiotics do not work on viruses..If I go to a doctor when suffering from the common cold, I am told to ride it out and take paracetamol for aches and pains. That makes sense as the common cold is caused by a virus..If visiting the doctor because a chest infection arises however, a course of antibiotics is often prescribed....How does a doctor manage to determine that the chest infection is a bacterial infection rather than a viral infection from the common cold virus?..If the bacterial infection arose out of a common cold infection, why is it the bacterial infection occurred and not a viral infection?.', 'answer_id': '22929', 'answer': 'This is actually a pretty complicated question because viral infections can damage the lungs in a way that makes subsequent bacterial infections possible/likely and it\\'s often these that are fatal. So if co-occurring both may need to be treated, with different medications, or the viral infection may be ignored sometimes. It basically depends on the severity of the pneumonia (which I\\'m guessing it\\'s what you mean by \"chest infection\"). For some background on causes of pneumonia:...  Pneumonia is an infection of the lung that causes the alveoli, or air sacs, to fill up with fluid or pus. [...]  If pneumonia does not resolve it can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and decreased pulmonary function..  .  There are several viral infections that lead to pneumonia (16). Influenza A virus (IAV) primarily infects the lung epithelium, and can cause viral pneumonia. [...] There are also a variety of other viruses that can infect the lower respiratory tract and lead to pneumonia, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, human metapneumonia, and some adenoviruses (14, 18–22). Rhinoviruses and newly described coronaviruses also infect the respiratory tract and cause disease. [...].  .  A variety of bacteria can also lead to the development of pneumonia. Bacterial pathogens as well as opportunistic infections (also known as pathobionts) can lead to pneumonia when allowed to infect the lower respiratory region. Bacteria that cause LRTIs naturally colonize the nasopharynx, but can cause disease when allowed to proliferate in the lower respiratory region (24–28). The most common examples of these are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Other bacteria are acquired from the environment, and often these bacteria have specific virulence factors that allow for the adaptation and infection of the lower respiratory tract (29). [...].  .  The vast majority of research in infection biology has been devoted to studying the interactions of a single pathogen with a host. In addition to single infections causing pneumonia, a common complication following infection with respiratory viruses is bacterial pneumonia (9, 26, 39–56).Many clinical infections and presumably subclinical infections are often in fact coinfections, in that two (or more) pathogens simultaneously or in close temporal proximity infect a single host (9, 26, 39–59). These infections are termed secondary infection, superinfection, or coinfection. The simultaneous response of two pathogens can manifest in many ways and often results in increased morbidity and mortality. .  .  To determine the best treatment options for patients with complex viral/bacterial coinfections increased understanding of the interplay between pathogens and the interaction with the host is necessary. Several viruses and bacteria have been shown to interact to worsen clinical outcomes. It is now believed that most of the deaths associated with the 1918 influenza pandemic were caused by superinfection with bacteria (60, 61). IAV/S. pneumoniae coinfection is perhaps the most well-studied example of viral/bacterial coinfection of the lung (62). However, bacterial coinfection also complicates infection with other respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus, metapneumonovirus, RSV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and coronavirus (52, 63–66). Young children are especially vulnerable to bacterial complications following viral infection (44, 62, 67, 68)....So the NICE (i.e. UK) guidelines for diagnosing pneumonia say for example:...  Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a lower respiratory tract infection most commonly caused by bacteria; however, viruses are thought to cause approximately 13% of cases in adults, and approximately 66% of cases in children and young people. The main bacterial pathogen causing CAP is Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Haemophilus influenzae; epidemics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae occur approximately every 4 years in the UK, and mainly affect children..  .  Inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for respiratory tract infections is common in general practice. [...]...So if you are an adult suffering from pneumonia (the Covid-19 pandemic aside) chances are you more likely you have bacterial pneumonia....  NG120 also emphasises the importance of face-to-face clinical examination in patients with acute cough if prescription of an antibiotic is being considered. Clinicians should therefore avoid issuing antibiotics for cough without a face-to-face examination. If bacterial pneumonia is suspected, it is important to assess the clinical signs and to determine their severity. [...].  .  An antibiotic should be offered within 4 hours of establishing a diagnosis of pneumonia, and a 5-day course is considered appropriate in all severity gradings....Also worth quoting from those guidelines:...  In practice, patients often return at the end of the antibiotic course due to concerns that symptoms have not resolved; however, in pneumonia, we should not expect symptom resolution at this stage. When issuing an antibiotic, it is important to explain to patients that their symptoms are highly unlikely to have resolved at the end of the course, but that the infection will have been adequately treated. It may be helpful to bear in mind that chest X-rays are not expected to return to normal for up to 6 weeks after pneumonia, reflecting the ongoing inflammatory rather than infective process..  .  Sputum samples do not need to be routinely sent for patients with CAP treated in primary care. However, they can be useful if signs or symptoms have not improved as expected after antibiotic treatment, or in people who have previously had frequent courses of antibiotics, as this increases the likelihood of resistant organisms....Basically, unless the pneumonia is severe enough (to require hospitalization), you won\\'t get a test to determine the agent that caused it, unless the first course antibiotic doesn\\'t resolve it...I can tell you from general experience that the cause of pneumonia will get tested in severe cases in a hospital setting in almost any country. (There are probably some WHO guidelines for this, but I can\\'t be bothered to search them now.)..Short coda on Covid-19:...  A study of 191 patients in two Wuhan hospitals showed that 50 percent of those who died tested positive for secondary infections compared to only one of the 137 survivors. In this situation, antibiotics form a crucial second line of defence.

Coronaviruses invade the respiratory tract via the nose.

The disease resolves in a few days, during which virus is shed in nasal secretions. There is some evidence that the respiratory coronaviruses can cause disease of the lower airways but it is unlikely that this is due to direct invasion. Other manifestations of disease such as multiple sclerosis have been attributed to these viruses but the evidence is not clear-cut..  .  Studies in both organ cultures and human volunteers show that coronaviruses are extremely fastidious and grow only in differentiated respiratory epithelial cells. Infected cells become vacuolated, show damaged cilia, and may form syncytia.

Olive oil is one of the best oils you can use to cook. It is mainly composed by monounsaturated fatty acids (1), that are neutral to cardiovascular risk and blood cholesterol. There are some oils that are better, by this point of view, like canola oil, that has a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, that are beneficial to cardiovascular risk.

WHO and ICTV were in communication about the naming of both the virus and the disease....So yeah, the two names originate from different organizations (as far as I can tell the ICTV is not subordinated to the WHO in any way), but they apparently held some talks on the matter.

From a risk communications perspective, using the name SARS can have unintended consequences in terms of creating unnecessary fear for some populations, especially in Asia which was worst affected by the SARS outbreak in 2003. .  .  For that reason and others, WHO has begun referring to the virus as “the virus responsible for COVID-19” or “the COVID-19 virus” when communicating with the public.  Neither of these designations are intended as replacements for the official name of the virus as agreed by the ICTV....Likewise, some virologists were displeased with the WHO name.

By uncoupling the naming conventions used for coronaviruses and the diseases that some of them cause in humans and animals, we wish to support the WHO in its efforts to establish disease names in the most appropriate way. [...] The further advancement of naming conventions is also important because the ongoing discovery of new human and animal viruses by next-generation sequencing technologies can be expected to produce an increasing number of viruses that do not (easily) fit the virus–disease model that was widely used in the pre-genomic era [...]. Having now established different names for the causative virus (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease (COVID-19), the CSG hopes that this will raise awareness in both the general public and public health authorities regarding the difference between these two entities.

Post-viral anosmia is one of the leading causes of loss of sense of smell in adults, accounting for up to 40% cases of anosmia. Viruses that give rise to the common cold are well known to cause post-infectious loss, and over 200 different viruses are known to cause upper respiratory tract infections. Previously described coronaviruses are thought to account for 10-15% cases. It is therefore perhaps no surprise that the novel COVID-19 virus would also cause anosmia in infected patients....But people are reporting anosmia as a presenting symptom.  What are the percentages here?.', 'answer_id': '21624', 'answer': 'This situation has not been fully characterised yet and has not been reported in the cases as a significant presentation before.  But ENT UK has issued the following advisory and hopes to stall the inappropriate use of steroids for anosmia...  There is already good evidence from South Korea, China and Italy that significant numbers of patients with proven COVID-19 infection have developed anosmia/hyposmia. In Germany it is reported that more than 2 in 3 confirmed cases have anosmia. In South Korea, where testing has been more widespread, 30% of patients testing positive have had anosmia as their major presenting symptom in otherwise mild cases. .  .  In addition, there have been a rapidly growing number of reports of a significant increase in the number of patients presenting with anosmia in the absence of other symptoms – this has been widely shared on medical discussion boards by surgeons from all regions managing a high incidence of cases. Iran has reported a sudden increase in cases of isolated anosmia, and many colleagues from the US, France and Northern Italy have the same experience. I have personally seen four patients this week, all under 40, and otherwise asymptomatic except for the recent onset of anosmia – I usually see roughly no more than one a month. I think these patients may be some of the hitherto hidden carriers that have facilitated the rapid spread of COVID-19. Unfortunately, these patients do not meet current criteria for testing or self-isolation..  .  While there is a chance the apparent increase in incidence could merely reflect the attention COVID-19 has attracted in the media, and that such cases may be caused by typical rhinovirus and coronavirus strains, it could potentially be used as a screening tool to help identify otherwise asymptomatic patients, who could then be better instructed on self-isolation..  .  Given the potential for COVID-19 to present with anosmia, and the reports that corticosteroid use may increase the severity of infection, we would advise against use of oral steroids in the treatment of new onset anosmia during the pandemic, particularly if it is unrelated to head trauma or nasal pathology (such as nasal polyps)..  .  There is potential that if any adult with anosmia but no other symptoms was asked to self-isolate for seven days, in addition to the current symptom criteria used to trigger quarantine, we might be able to reduce the number of otherwise asymptomatic individuals who continue to act as vectors, not realising the need to self-isolate. It will also be an important trigger for healthcare personnel to employ full PPE and help to counter the higher rates of infection found amongst ENT surgeons compared to other healthcare workers. ...https://www.entuk.org/loss-sense-smell-marker-covid-19-infection.', 'answer_type': 'Reasonable', 'wrong_answer': 'Yes, there is evidence that alkaline food affects internal pH, but it is important to note that the regulation of internal pH (acid-base homeostatis) has other contributing factors, which is why the impact of food is subtle...I\\'m mainly aware of evidence from studies on sodium bicarbonate, as an example for a simple way to supplement alkaline food....Gabriela Froio de Araujo Dias et al: (In)Consistencies in Responses to Sodium Bicarbonate Supplementation: A Randomised, Repeated Measures, Counterbalanced and Double-Blind Study..This experiment studies the effect of sodium bicarbonate as a pre-workout supplement.

Kox et al: Voluntary Activation of The Sympathetic Nervous System and Attenuation of the Innate Immune Response In Humans..This article studies the effect of the Wim Hof method, in particular its breathing technique. The breathing technique basically alternates between voluntary hyperventilation and breath holds. The supplementary material features a video of one subject performing the breathing technique, including monitoring of blood pH over the course of the exercise. The subject has a basline blood pH of 7.4. During hyperventilation, blood pH increases over 7.6 as a result of the reduced carbon dioxide levels in the blood. During breath retention, carbon dioxide levels normalize and the blood pH falls (almost) back to the baseline level. Note that these effects on pH are very quick compared to nutritional influences....This example shows why it is difficult to separate the effect from alkaline food from other factors contributing to pH homeostasis. Taking a few deep breaths or holding your breath has a very immediate effect on blood pH, which can easily bias the more subtle effect from an alkaline diet. I\\'m not an expert, but I could imagine that the respiratory rate is even determined by dietary factors. Thus, instead of studying the effect on internal pH, it might be more sensible to show that an alkaline diet leads to reduced breathing in the long term, because the body could maintain the same pH level even with higher carbon dioxide levels..', 'wrong_answer_type': 'Random', 'url': 'health.stackexchange.com', 'source': 'biomedical'}",

Feelings of centrality or solipsism may come to the fore....And from Phenomenology of anomalous self-experience in early schizophrenia:....A classic is Knots (1970) by R.D. Laing who was both a psychiatrist and someone who experienced psychosis. I recommend getting a hold of it. It\\'s very short and will make no sense.

Open any one of these, and you will find abundant cases in which.  ‘mystical ideas’ are cited as characteristic symptoms of enfeebled or.  deluded states of mind.

It\\'s called mystical experience. Claiming you have insight into the nature of reality will not be called psychosis if one displays minimal or no impairment, and if you can convince others that what you\\'re experiencing is a reality of a type they are willing to entertain as existing.

He also stated that the sample can be resized along the way. In this regard, Streinu-Cercel referred to the recommendations of the World Health Organization, which asked that testing be conducted to detect COVID 19. The manager of the “Matei Bals” Institute showed that it is necessary to test the medical staff and patients, but also the population, in order to know if “it’s healthy, if it is currently infected or went through the infection” with this virus, these three pieces of information completely changing how this pandemic is approached in the near future. [...].  .  Streinu-Cercel underscored that, in lack of screening, the mild forms can go undetected, generating subsequent forms of severe infections. He also mentioned that the Minister of Health approved this project and stressed that this is a study with “scientific value,” not a simple testing. At the same time, he mentioned that in Bucharest there are 188 people diagnosed positively....Note that ~200 cases in 2M is 1:10,000...Ha, ha, the more amusing part is that this turned out to be \"fake news!\" But it\\'s actually informative to read the \"retraction/information\" as to why they are not actually doing such a study [obviously: insufficient testing capacity for the proposed sample.]...  After the manager of the “Matei Bals” Institute for Infectious Diseases, Adrian Streinu-Cercel and Bucharest mayor Gabriela Firea had announced on Thursday that 10,514 people from 5 different age groups in Bucharest will be tested for the novel Coronavirus, PM Ludovic Orban reacted and said this is not possible..  .  “We cannot establish the people to be tested randomly. Selecting 10,000 are just stories, there is a priority list for testing, it depends on how the situation and the testing capacity are developing,” the PM told a conference at the Health Ministry’s HQs..  .  Orban said that the medical staff and those targeted by the epidemiological inquiries are qualifying for testing first, adding that “Romania has not been ready and the testing capacity has been limited”..  .  The premier said that “the testing capacity in Romania will increase up to 2,000 next week” and will gradually rise, but to select 10,000 people “are just stories”, the more the death toll has been low in Romania....In older news I see that India conducted a random test on 500 of their citizens.

Can\\'t wrap my head around it. Even if the doubling time  is 6 days, in theory (I realise the curve will naturally flatten as a result of population size and number of people already infected) you\\'re still going to see an exponential increases in cases (i.e. 50000, 100000, 200000, 400000...).', 'answer_id': '21704', 'answer': 'One of the issues with COVID-19 is the fact that it is transmissible even by people who are asymptomatic. You\\'ve probably heard about R0, which is the basic reproduction rate of a disease, that takes into account transmission modes and contact rate, among other things. I\\'m not an epidemiologist, but I\\'m operating under the assumption that someone who is obviously sick will infect relatively fewer people than someone who is asymptomatic, assuming similar contagiousness - the sick person should quarantine themself and clearly take measures to avoid spreading their sickness. A seemingly well individual, on the other hand, may not reduce their contact rate and unwittingly spread the disease. ..Under this assumption, consider what happens when the incubation time is equal to the doubling rate. Suppose we have 1000 individuals who have the disease, but don\\'t know it yet because they are still in the incubation period. 5.8 days later, there are now 2000 people with the disease, 1000 of which now feel sick, and 1000 of which still feel fine. Those 1000 sick people quarantine themselves, dramatically lowering their rate of infecting others, let\\'s say to 0 for the sake of simplicity. 5.8 days later, the 1000 asymptomatic people now feel sick, after having infected another 1000 people, although the 1000 already-sick individuals haven\\'t infected anyone else. At this rate, we have a linear increase in the number of cases, since old cases are quarantining themselves at the same rate new cases are spread - the number of people spreading the disease unwittingly remains constant!..I\\'ve made several assumptions here, like that the transmission rate for asymptomatic individuals is higher than that of symptomatic individuals (although some symptoms, like cough, increase infectivity, and not all symptomatic individuals quarantine appropriately). I\\'m also not sure this is really an appropriate use of \"doubling time\" - strictly speaking, if 1000 people quarantine, and 1000 asymptomatic people infect 1000 others, it is not a doubling of cases. The statement also seems a bit of tautological red herring - if you are able to lengthen the doubling time, you have already flattened the curve, regardless of the incubation period.

Fortunately, you have asked a question about an area where rigorous data are available showing reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality on the basis of randomized, controlled trials...Cardiovascular events  ..In large-scale randomized trials of people with primary hypertension,  antihypertensive therapy produces a nearly 50 percent relative risk reduction in the incidence of heart failure, a 30 to 40 percent relative risk reduction in stroke, and a 20 to 25 percent relative risk reduction in myocardial infarction.1,2,3,4 ..The benefits show a consistent \"dose-response\" relationship. That is, larger improvements in blood pressure control are associated with greater decreases in risk. This is an important point, since it adds credibility to the association. This is demonstrated in graphs like this one:....Image from Reference 1, below: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2386598/  ..On the x-axis you see the degree of blood pressure lowering achieved with medications. On the y-axis is “relative risk” (RR). By definition, a null intervention yields RR=1. A relative risk of 0.5 represents a 50% decreased risk, etc. ..The graph is showing meta-analysis data, i.e. data compiled from many clinical trials in order to increase statistical power. The basic idea is that each circle is a clinical trial and bigger circles represent “stronger” data (i.e. with lower variance). The regression line shows that there is a linear relationship between the degree of blood pressure lowering and the relative risk reduction (here for a composite endpoint of stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure.) This analysis included 31 randomized, placebo-controlled trials, with 190,606 participants. These are strong data. ..Mortality data  ..In addition to the dramatic reductions in adverse cardiovascular outcomes, blood pressure control has also been shown to reduce mortality. One meta-analysis used data from 42 randomized, controlled studies including nearly 200,000 subjects (Psaty). They found a reduction in cardiovascular disease mortality (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73-0.92); and total mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.96). The fact that these relative risk (RR) confidence intervals do not cross 1 demonstrates statistical significance. ..Although the RR value of 0.90 is considerably less impressive than the reductions in more specific outcomes (stroke, heart failure, etc), this is expected due to the myriad of other factors affecting mortality. A statistically significant relative risk of 0.90 for mortality is actually quite dramatic. One would be challenged to find any other intervention for primary prevention that, in randomized trials, can be shown to decrease overall mortality with this degree of certainty...Conclusion  ..There are many interventions in modern medicine that are of questionable long-term benefit to healthy patients (i.e. primary prevention).** These include cholesterol lowering medications, aspirin, various forms of cancer screening, etc. In most cases, the disease-specific improvements in outcomes are subtle and debated, and randomized data showing a reduction in overall mortality are lacking or inconsistent. The use of blood pressure lowering medications in patients with hypertension falls into a different category. These medications are effective. ...*That is, interventions aimed at preventing disease in healthy people. This is in contrast to secondary prevention, treating people after they have already had an adverse outcome. In general, secondary prevention is a much \"easier\" arena in which to demonstrate benefit because the risk of adverse outcomes is so much higher..   ...**Here, I’m considering hypertension, hyperlipidemia to fall within the range of “healthy” because these abnormalities are only problematic if they cause a cardiovascular event of some sort......References  ...Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists\\' Collaboration, Turnbull F, Neal B, Ninomiya T, Algert C, Arima H, Barzi F, Bulpitt C, Chalmers J, Fagard R, Gleason A, Heritier S, Li N, Perkovic V, Woodward M, MacMahon S.

Ιn lieu of that, I'm going to use one study to illustrate a couple methodological points to show you why this answer is difficult to know. My goal is to help the reader develop a skeptical eye when research of this type is presented...One study used teacher questionnaires about hyperactivity symptoms and student questionnaires about dietary habits to see if a relationship existed between high sugar intake and hyperactivity. They found that children were at statistically higher risk for ADHD if they consumed:  ...less sugar from fruit snacks  .low Vitamin C ...However, the total simple sugar intake did not correlate with hyperactivity symptoms...This makes very little sense. Why should fruit snacks be different from other sugar, and where did Vitamin C come from?...Statistical noise. Data interpretation relies on a ratio of signal:noise to find the signal (in this case, an association). A 5-second brainstorm will bring to mind dozens of unrelated (to usual dietary patterns) topics that may affect what students write down on questionnaires: literacy, gender, upbringing, vocabulary, organization, memory, day-of-the-week, recent holidays, who won the Red Sox game, etc. etc. etc. Some of these may reflect recent dietary patterns that skew the memory of usual dietary patterns; others simply affect the accuracy of report. One could generate an equally diverse list of factors that may affect teacher reports. Either way, the result is the same: a noisy signal..Confounding. A confound exists when an extraneous factor exists that correlates with both the independent (dietary report) and the dependent (inattentiveness) variable. In this case, one could imagine that students who tend to be careless about reporting might also be those displaying symptoms of hyperactivity (which tends to run with inattentiveness). It’s not obvious whether that would lead to under or over reporting of sugar intake. ..Generally, obvious confounders can be adjusted for statistically (here, I don't see that they did much of that, although they did do separate analyses for boys vs girls). However, no amount of math can adjust for factors that aren’t measured. There was no “carelessness independent of hyperactivity” score obtained here, and we couldn’t expect it &mdash; it’s a basically unknowable parameter. Certain confounders are inherent to the methodology. Math never fixes this..Multiple comparisons. The basic principle is: if you look at enough factors, something is going to be statistically associated with something else for reasons that have nothing to do with reality. That’s because we define statistical significance as a result that would occur by chance &lt;5% of the time. If you run 20 tests, you have a good chance of coming up with one of them that appears to be positive simply by chance. In data that has a low signal:noise ratio (see #1), this problem is all the more apparent.

We also docked ML188 with the SARS-CoV 3CLpro structure (PDB ID: 3M3V) as a reference, and ML188 bound strongly to the receptor binding site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The inhibitor targets the Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) along with the other residues, and the docking score (S\\u202f=\\u202f−12.27) was relatively high.

A BCV DI RNA lacking a poly(A) tail was unable to replicate; however, a MHV DI lacking a tail did replicate following multiple virus passages. Poly(A) tail extension/repair was concurrent with robust replication of the tail mutants. Binding of the host factor poly(A)- binding protein (PABP) appeared to correlate with the ability of DI RNAs to be replicated.

It has been demonstrated that the length of the coronaviral poly(A) tail is not static but regulated during infection; however, little is known regarding the factors involved in coronaviral polyadenylation and its regulation. Here, we show that during infection, the level of coronavirus poly(A) tail lengthening depends on the initial length upon infection and that the minimum length to initiate lengthening may lie between 5 and 9 nucleotides. By mutagenesis analysis, it was found that (i) the hexamer AGUAAA and poly(A) tail are two important elements responsible for synthesis of the coronavirus poly(A) tail and may function in concert to accomplish polyadenylation and (ii) the function of the hexamer AGUAAA in coronaviral polyadenylation is position dependent. Based on these findings, we propose a process for how the coronaviral poly(A) tail is synthesized and undergoes variation. Our results provide the first genetic evidence to gain insight into coronaviral polyadenylation..  .

PLoS ONE 11(10): e0165077...This builds upon prior work by Hung-Yi Wu et al, which showed that the coronaviral 3' poly(A) tail is approximately 65 nucleotides in length in both genomic and sgmRNAs at peak viral RNA synthesis, and also observed that the precise length varied throughout infection. Most interestingly, they report:...  Functional analyses of poly(A) tail length on specific viral RNA species, furthermore, revealed that translation, in vivo, of RNAs with the longer poly(A) tail was enhanced over those with the shorter poly(A). Although the mechanisms by which the tail lengths vary is unknown, experimental results together suggest that the length of the poly(A) and poly(U) tails is regulated. One potential function of regulated poly(A) tail length might be that for the coronavirus genome a longer poly(A) favors translation. The regulation of coronavirus translation by poly(A) tail length resembles that during embryonal development suggesting there may be mechanistic parallels..  .  Wu HY, Ke TY, Liao WY, Chang NY.

Eukaryotic mRNA almost always contains poly(A) tails, which are added post-transcriptionally in a process known as polyadenylation. It should not therefore be surprising that positive-strand RNA viruses would have poly(A) tails as well.

The key concern is the genetic similarities to SARS epidemic, and relates to the SARS receptor. ..SARS background SARS is endemic in bats (your BioRxiv tree partly shows that and this tree definitely shows it) and in the 2002 epidemic infected civet cats which then infected humans. More importantly it is then transmitted from one human to another. This is a consequence of the SARS receptor been able to exploit the cellular receptors in the respiratory tract of bats, civet cats and humans and use this tissue as a site of replication. The concern is exacerbated because the tree here shows SARS independently infected humans on two separate occasions, suggesting the cross-over has an underlying genetic basis, which is part of the \"SARS lineage\"...BioRxiv 2019-nCov tree Your tree shows the 2019-nCov has a recent common ancestor with SARS in comparison to the rest of the betacoronaviruses. This therefore provides some circumstantial evidence the receptor mechanism and ability to frequently crossover from bats and ultimately transmit human to human could be shared with SARS. At an evolutionary level (which is what ANY tree is supposed to reconstruct) it raises the question which common ancestor of SARS did the \"SARS receptor\" originate. I\\'d need to draw a diagram to better demonstrate this point, but I hope you get the idea...The \"influenza receptor\" The analogy is with influenza virus and the entire epidemiology of influenza hinges around is sialic acid receptor of influenza and its ability to bind on to the cellular receptors in the upper/lower respiratory tract of birds, pigs and humans. The hypothesised mechanism is called the mixing vessel theory and is the classic epidemiological understanding of how new pathogenic influenza pandemics occur. If you replace \"birds and pigs\" with e.g. \"bats, civet cats and humans\" you get the idea why this could be scary. We don\\'t the intemediate host of 2019-nCov ... but I speculate there must be one, unless eating Cov-infected bats is common in China...Technical details of the BioRxiv tree The tree is a nicely diverse selection of the beta-coronaviruses. The authors have rooted the tree using the outgroups of delacoronaviruses and gammacoronaviruses, so it is a good robust selection of outgroups which can be used to correctly identify the direct of evolution of betacoronavirus divergence. In tree theory (its formal name is phylogenetics theory), extensive rooting is good and minimises artefacts...One of the earliest members of the betacoronaviruses to diverge is MERS (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome), which form a single \"clade\" (all viruses share a unique common ancestor) and these represent around 50% amino acid divergence from SARS/2019-nCov. The selection of MERS in the tree from both camels and humans looks good. The selection of other betacoronaviruses looks great, I wasn\\'t aware of the \"ruminant clade\"  at all involving buffalo, cow etc .. infections and there was an associated human infection. There are loads of bat isolates of the betacoronaviruses throughout the tree, but we eventually arrive at the \"SARS clade\". The authors show that 2019-nCov is an outgroup to the SARS clade and shows a close relationship to one (BioRxiv tree) or two (this tree) bat isolates. Looking at the precise SARS clade (better shown in this tree) we can see loads of bat virus associating with SARS lineages. We therefore assume the reservoir to SARS and likely 2019-nCov is bat, moreover that the single ancestor to both viruses was a bat (it is called a parsimonious hypothesis). ..The one thing the BioRXiv tree omits, for example with regards this tree, is the diversity of SARS and in particularly the two independent origins of SARS, which is a weakness of their analysis, particular if this fed into downstream analysis. It is not to say the authors were wrong, but it was uncool. ..Word of caution my understanding is the divergence between SARS and 2010-nCov is around 15% and this is a quite a large amount of genetic divergence, even if both viruses share a most recent common-ancestor, form part of the same clade and receptor peptide motifs. Nevertheless there is sufficient amino acid divergence to generate notable differences in epidemiology, clinical symptom and transmission. ..MERS, SARS and 2019-nCov mortality rates It is worth noting that within the betacoronaviruses the mortality rates between difference clinically important viruses is very different. MERS has a mortality rate of 40-60%, SARS is around 10% but 2019-nCov is &lt;2.5%. The 2019-nCov mortality rate is still important given it has infected more and could potentially infect alot more people than SARS..', 'answer_type': 'Accepted', 'wrong_answer': 'You could give a try with dplyr\\'s full_join() and purrr\\'s reduce(). full_join() will make sure that you won\\'t lose any data and reduce() will merge tables in your list from left to right, left being the first table of the list in the first iteration but would become merged table1+table2 in the second iteration and so on.

Bats lineages are present at every single point of the betacoronavirus phylogeny (tree), both as paraphyletic and monophyletic lineages, one example is this tree of betacoronaviruses here. Meaning the nodes connecting the branches of the tree to the \"master-branch\", represent common ancestors and these were almost certainly bat-borne cornaviruses. This is especially true for SARS and - here bat-viruses are EVERYWHERE. .The tree here also shows that SARS arose on independently on two occassions, again surrounded by bat lineages and 2019-nCov has emerged separately at least once, again associated with bats. .Finally the tree below is a figure from BioRxiv Zhou et al (2020) \"Discovery of a novel coronavirus associated with the recent pneumonia outbreak in humans and its potential bat origin\" shows the 2019-nCov lineage is a direct descendent of a very closely virus isolated from a bat (RaTG13*). This is a really conclusive finding BTW.....Note, I don\\'t normally present inline images, but it is such a nice finding (hint to reviewers) and BioRxiv is open access...Conspiracy theory 1: laboratory made virus..Literally it would require someone passaging a new virus, with unknown human pathogenicity, and independently introducing all the earlier passages enmass across bat populations of China. They would then hope each lineage becomes an indepedent virus population before, then introducing the virus to humans. Thus when field teams of scientists go around using mist nets to trap the bats, buy them from markets, isolate the virus and sequence it they would find a beautiful, array of natural variation in the bat populations leading up to the human epidemics, that perfectly matches vast numbers of other viral zoonoses. Moreover, this would have to have happen substancially prior to SARS and 2019-nCov, because the bat betacoronaviruses have been known about prior both epidemics, viz. its simply not feasible...Biological explanation.General Bats are a reservoir host to vast numbers of pathogens, particularly viruses, including many alphaviruses, flaviviruses, rabies virus and beleived to be important in ebolavirus (I don\\'t know about this) and even important to several eukaryotic parasites. It makes sense, they are mammals, so evolutionary much closer to us than birds for example, with large dispersal potential and roost in \\'overcrowded\\' areas enable rapid transmission between bats...Technical.The trees show bats are the common ancestor of betacoronaviruses in particular for the lineage leading into the emergence of 2019-nCov and SARS, this is seen in this tree, this one and the tree above. The obvious explanation is the virus circulates endemically in bats and has jumped into humans. For SARS the intermediate host, or possible \"vector\" was civet cats. ..The theory and the observations fit into a seamless biological answer...Conspiracy theory 2: Middle Eastern connection..I heard a very weird conspiracy theory attempting to connect MERS with 2019-nCov. The theory was elaborate and I don\\'t think it is productive to describe here...Biological explanation.All the trees of betacoronaviruses show MERS was one of the earliest viruses to diverge and is very distant from 2019-nCov, to the extent the theory is completely implausible. The homology between these viruses is 50%, so its either MERS or 2019-nCov. Its more extreme than mixing up yellow fever virus (mortality 40-80%) with West Nile virus (mortality &lt;&lt;0.1%), the two viruses are completely different at every level...What about errors? Phylogeneticists can spot it a mile off. There are tell-tale phylogenetic signatures we pick up, but also we do this to assess \\'rare\\' genetic phenomina. There is nothing \\'rare\\' about the coronaviruses. The only anomaly is variation in the poly-A tail and that is the natural variation from in vitro time-series experiments. Basically we\\'ve looked at enough virses/parasites through trees, that have no conspiracy theories at all (often neglected diseases), and understand how natural variation operates - so a phylogenecist can shift the wheat from the chaff without really thinking about it...Opinion.The conspiracy theories are deeply misplaced, and the only connection I can imagine is its China. However, the Chinese have loads of viruses, influenza in particular which causes major pandemics, but that is a consequence of their natural ecology (small-holder farming) allowing the virus to move between reservoir hosts.

It represents, in effect, the number of further cases each new case will give rise to. If R is high, the number of newly infected people climbs quickly to a peak before, for want of new people to infect, starting to fall back again (see chart 2). If R is low the curve rises and falls more slowly, never reaching the same heights. With sars-cov-2 now spread around the world, the aim of public-health policy, whether at the city, national or global scale, is to flatten the curve, spreading the infections out over time...I am having trouble with this. There are 2 curves here. First of all, I am not sure of the different processes that determine them. It says one is without measures. The other is with measures. But it also says one is with high R and the other with low R. Is R a fixed constant for a disease? Alternatively, is there some variability in R and does that degree of variation affect transmission? This is not explained or stated in the article and I haven't heard R described in this way. At best it is not written clearly in my opinion. ..In addition, does without measures necessarily imply high R? Is that what they are getting at? Also, it looks to me as though the blue graph goes to zero very quickly, basically when t is equal to the mean of the orange curve. That means that without measures the epidemic will end quickly (because it exhausts all the possible patients). ..Finally the areas under the two curves is about the same. This means that the number of patients is about the same with or without measures. ..Anyway, can anyone clear up any of this?.\", 'answer_id': '11553', 'answer': 'R is a reference to R0, otherwise known as the basic reproductive rate, and means the number of new cases from a single patient infection. R0 has to be above 1 for a disease to persist. It is a classic equation which account for the probability of transmission against immunity. The y-axis is the number of infecteds, very poorly presented...The idea is that R0 will be lower if there is containment (less people to infect because you can\\'t move around), but will last longer, possibly because the number of naive patients (not encountered the virus) will be larger over a longer period of time. ..That particular graph appears to be saying that everyone at risk of infection will get infected with or without control measures (the surface area under the graphs is approximately the same*) and the only thing that will halt the virus is acquired immunity. If this is mainstream economic thinking then I beg to differ, albeit I note the source is CDC (again see note*). ..For example, all other respiratory viral infections are seasonal. If COVID-19  is seasonal containment is the right choice, because the window of transmission is limited...*, Given this is of CDC origin I think either its a mistake, or at the very least was taken out of context, because the idea is that overall there is a lower number of people infected as a result of \"social distancing\" and that does not appear to be what the two curves show..', 'answer_type': 'Reasonable', 'wrong_answer': 'Early MinION sequencing runs had forward and reverse DNA templates joined together by a hairpin adapter, so that the sequencer would read both strands from the same template.

I know this from the underlying tree published on BioRxiv of a broader group of betacoronaviruses, i.e. your data is a defined subset of the betacoronaviruses which all share a unique, single common ancester...Lets call this group the SARS clade...You have performed a nucleotide blast and asked NCBI to produce a NJ tree using 2019-nCov as the reference. I can tell this by the colour coding and the scale bar at the bottom right hand corner shows the genetic distance involved is reasonably larger than 15% divergence by amino acid data. The scale bar represents the number of mutations per nucleotide. ..In summary, your tree is essentially a subset of the broader genetic diversity of the one published, but there is there is a rooting issue. ..In your tree, the majority of sequences are from the 2002 SARS epidemic and the virtually zero genetic distance between them is simply because it is a rapidly transmitted outbreak. I didn\\'t realize that SARS has two independent origins both initially from bats. This is quite scary. ...2019-nCov is an outgroup within the \\'SARS clade\\' hence it appears at the other side of the tree, i.e. they share a more distant common ancestor.However 2019-nCov is not the most distant common ancester within this subset of the betacoronaviruses, i.e. SARS clade, this belongs to the two bat viruses ZC45 and ZX21. The program has made a likely rooting error (below)..Again the blast omitted the majority of the betacoronaviruses, for example MERS...Rooting issue the reason I suggest there is a rooting error is because the BioRxiv tree using a broad sample of the betacoronaviruses placed the bat strains ZC45 and ZX21 as outgroups to the SARS clade and 2019-nCOV was immediately within that, so in this definition 2019-nCOV is an \\'ingroup\\' within the SARS clade, whereas your tree it is an \\'outgroup\\'.

Clinical trials take a lot time as they need to be thorough (cf. the infamous thalidomide from the days with more lax testing)..There are several bottlenecks in drug design. These are technical based on our imperfect understanding of things, which results in less than ideal models. CPU time is not really an issue. Empirical validation is required at many steps along the way. This is greatly increased by automation. The XChem team at Diamond light source have done a fragment-screening against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease at an insane pace: things are changing fast!..Drug screen..There are many ways to make a drug. In one way, a test system was set up (a reporter assay) that gives you a measurable read-out, say mm of clearance of bacteria on a Petri dish (viability) around a cellulose dish soaked in different separated natural extracts —and you might find that Penicillium chrysogenum has a compound of interest. What you are doing is drug screen. Screening a large panel of compounds (of varying purity) does not necessarily require knowing the protein target...Rational drug design..Fast forward to this decade and it becomes possible to predict the free energy release upon binding of a small molecule against a protein —mostly...This requires a solved 3D structure of the protein by X-ray crystallography. Crystallising a protein is a tricky business, as a pure protein sample has to come out of solution in a folded form to form a neat lattice as opposed to just making unfolded gunk. What salt conditions work? Anyone\\'s guess. Some have done deep learning on it, but the best solution is to have a robot try a very large range of combinations...Once you have a protein structure you can predict what fits into the part that you want to target, say an active site or an interface. This is not done by simple cartesian geometric shape fitting like LEGO bricks as there are many molecular forces involved. So a mathematical model of these forces is made, called a force field. Many have been made, a lot of study has gone into these, but they are not perfect. It is all made worse by the fact that we cannot really model water properly —most models use a proxy (implicit solvent) or use non-polarisable water..This is all while made worse by the fact that a protein is not static but wobbles (following the same mathematical models). So a ligand does not slot in really like a key in a lock, but has an induced fit. Modelling all this is accurately is problematic, but one can still try: calculating where exactly a ligand binds to a protein is called for which one gets energy difference upon binding. And one can try an inordinate amount of small molecules —Zinc DB contains 230 million purchasable compounds. This is called a virtual screen. One can even start with the natural substrate and \"weaponise it\" by adding chemical groups that do a chemical reaction that breaks the protein. However, a metabolite is very different from a drug (cf. Lipinski\\'s rule of five) as the latter must cross membranes etc. But generally the accuracy is not great without multiple steps of empirical validation...To improve the results from a virtual screen the most common approach is to do a fragment screen to guide it. This is to automatedly soak protein crystals with a large library of small compounds and see which crystal contains a bound hit. The hits can be expanded into bigger fragments in a virtual screens and the short list of compounds tested (these are not cheap) by soaking and crystallising again..In the case of Covid19 virus, the cool thing is that this whole process is open in the aforementioned current campaign (Diamond is a government owned synchrotron and not a big pharma). What is really nice about this is that for the second cycle comp-chemists from everywhere have done their own guided virtual screen and have submit compounds (which you can see publicly)...It should be said that drug screens that are not rational design are still a thing. The recent antibiotic-discovering deep-learning paper in Cell]6 is such an example, although it should be said that it was a feat not only in AI but also in automated empirical testing...Future..Automation via better and open software will definitely improve. With a small drive possibly from the dissemination of easy to use and to code off-the-shelf electronics, such as Rasperry Pis or Arduinos. But mainly with more complex machines such as the Opentron system (a python-controlled robot)...But indubitably where the greatest improvement can come is better mathematical models. Possibly even with deep learning. After all researches were amused last year-ish (2018 competition) when DeepMind \"won\" the protein 3D structure (fold) modelling competition (CASP13) and there have definitely been some really nice results in the field of docking with hybrid models.

Both her and her neighbor (let\\'s call him Bob) live in an apartment complex owned by a therapy organization they are both patients at, and their landlord is also the owner of said organization. Bob has lived there longer than Allison...Every once in a while (at least once a week, though sometimes a lot more often), Bob tends to be very noisy in his apartment, by listening to loud music or playing with a pinball machine (a physical, real life one, not a video game). This often also happens very late at night, which is obviously not allowed per contract, and the walls are incredibly thin. Allison has complained about this numerous times, as it prevents her from sleeping at night and her mental health is suffering because of it, which the therapy home was supposed to be helping with. The inhabitants of the other apartments don\\'t hear any noise, as Allison\\'s apartment is the only one that share\\'s a wall with Bob\\'s...The problem: Since Bob is a therapy patient himself, the landlord and the therapists appear to be protective of him. Supposedly, he has his own baggage that prevents him from noticing, caring or remembering that he\\'s being inconsiderate. While they don\\'t explicitly condone him doing this at night, they barely take any direct action. Instead, they advised Allison to use earplugs, since the person who lived in her apartment before her never complained about this and they figured she may just be too sensitive. When the earplugs didn\\'t help, they told her to message Bob whenever he\\'s being too loud, because he apparently needs constant reminding that he\\'s not supposed to do this after a certain time of day. Allison tried this, and it helped, but the silence usually only persists for a few minutes before being broken again...On Allison\\'s request, the landlord eventually agreed to order noise cancelling panels to be installed on the wall between their apartments. However, he only agreed to pay for the very cheapest ones available, which had to be shipped from China and are now being withheld due to the Corona virus. Furthermore, after it was clarified that these panels would need to be installed on Bob\\'s side of the wall in order to have any effect, Bob suddenly expressed that he\\'s not willing to put in the effort to do so. In other words, he refuses to actively do something to fix the problem he\\'s causing, despite the panels being gifted to him (Allison has expressed willingness to invest into panels for her side of the wall out of her own pocket, just for added sound isolation, but as stated earlier, those won\\'t do much on their own)...Recently, Allison\\'s therapist started encouraging her to look for other apartments, all of which turned out to be substantially more expensive than her current one (given similar size and quality). Despite knowing that Allison\\'s financial situation isn\\'t the best, her therapist kept suggesting that it might be worth it to get some peaceful nights. Allison feels like this is rather unfair, like she\\'s being punished for her neighbor breaking the contract and keeping her up at night, and that the landlord / therapy organization should put more effort into solving this for her, as the contract states that excessive noise at night is grounds for eviction. However, whenever she brings these arguments up, they keep getting dodged...Allison tried contacting the police about this, but they dismissed her case as something that\\'s out of their reach. They advised her to try something called a \"neighborhood mediation\", though Allison has strong doubts about the usefulness of such a thing, as the landlord and therapists have already tried mediating between the two of them...Question: Is there any other way to resolve this issue? Can a therapy organization get away with catering to one patient\\'s needs, despite that being extremely counterproductive to the needs of another patient, especially if the former is the one breaking the rules?

Can a therapy organization get away with catering to one patient\\'s needs, despite that being extremely counterproductive to the needs of another patient, especially if the former is the one breaking the rules? Is it legal for the landlord to blatantly ignore a contract that was signed by all the involved parties and not take any action against one of these parties breaking it and strongly inconveniencing another one?...First, it is important for Allison to distinguish between the existing legal relations and each one\\'s separate ramifications...The therapist looks manipulative and dishonest when encouraging Allison to rent a more expensive place, since at this point it seems that the therapist knew or should have known that the situation involves the landlord (who coincidentally is the therapist\\'s employer). At the very least, the therapist should have informed Allison that the therapist has a potential conflict of interest, and thus let Allison decide whether or not to rely on that organization\\'s services. Here, the therapist failed to make due disclosure...Instead, the therapist\\'s acts have all the appearance of accommodating its other customer (Bob), and ultimately trying not to disrupt its employer\\'s profits both as landlord and as therapy business owner. That conflict of interest sounds in therapist\\'s malpractice and may even amount to [therapist\\'s &amp; company\\'s] fraud...Regardless of whether Allison chooses to denounce the therapist and/or the business, she should ask herself whether a therapy organization with such practices is apt for continued treatment of --and the ensuing profits from-- Allison\\'s therapy needs. One aspect Allison needs to consider is that her continued business there would weaken her arguments if she eventually brings court proceedings against the therapist or his employer...Allison\\'s tenancy is a separate issue. Allison knows better than I (and the public in general) the terms of her lease and the physical details of her residential unit, so only she can compare them with section 7.4.2 of the Burgerlijke Wetboek to assess whether the lack of quiet enjoyment is attributable to a defect of the leased property (article 7:204.2). Allison should assess this issue from the standpoint of landlord\\'s possible allegation that \"\"the disturbance is caused by a third person\" (whereby the landlord would seek to avoid liability under 7:204.3). Depending on Allison\\'s determination of the aforementioned issue, she would have a claim against the landlord for breach of contract, and/or against Bob for tortious conduct (6:162)...There are at least three reasons why Allison should follow the police\\'s suggestion of neighborhood mediation. The first reason is that there has been essentially no mediation in Allison\\'s dispute. Mediation requires a nonparty whose neutrality is not compromised when conducting the mediation. That has been missing here so far. Allison has only dealt with third parties (i.e., the landlord and therapists) who are first and foremost reluctant to inconvenience their noisy client Bob for fear of affecting their own business interests. Allison\\'s belief that these people were conducting a form of mediation is mistaken...The second reason is that, from mediation, Allison may pursue and obtain a written &amp; signed agreement whereby Bob promises to desist from his pattern of disturbances (ideally Allison would secure an akin sort of commitment also from the landlord). In the event that Allison subsequently needs to sue either or both of the parties for the continued disturbances, filing in court these binding documents (which she would have obtained through mediation) will ease Allison\\'s burden of proof...The third reason is that genuine mediation might obviate Allison\\'s need to seek remedies in court. That is because it would teach both landlord and Bob that Allison is able and willing to take legal action if the situation persists or escalates, which might have a dissuading effect on them. Furthermore, mediation proceedings will give Allison some experience as to presenting her legal arguments in a more formal setting...Courts in Netherlands may grant injunctive relief in situations like Allison\\'s where the ongoing harm is not susceptible of being quantified in monetary terms. Allison may pursue that relief, which if granted would compel the police to enforce it each time Bob violates it..', 'answer_type': 'Accepted', 'wrong_answer': 'Arkansas does not appear to have its own version of the FMLA.

If the franchise is truly a stand-alone business with fewer than 50 employees then the FMLA would not apply. In the case of the Domino\\'s pizza franchise they were deemed to be integrated because they were the same franchise licensees of the same franchisor (Domino\\'s) and they had a common workers\\' comp policy...Do be aware that the 50 employee limit is not a permanent employee threshold.
