Reading Kaufmann and van Oudenaarden (2007), it seems to validate the first alternative (using results from the Central Limit Theorem):...  Although biochemical fluctuations influence all stages of gene expression, those involving molecules in extremely low abundance are expected from a statistical standpoint to be larger in magnitude and therefore to contribute disproportionately to the overall variation between cells.....Kaufmann, B. B. &amp; van Oudenaarden, A. Stochastic gene expression: from single molecules to the proteome. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 17, 107â€“112 (2007)...
