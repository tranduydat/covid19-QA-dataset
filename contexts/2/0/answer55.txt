The asymptomatic ratio is thus estimated at 41.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 16.7%, 66.7%) among evacuees. Because fourteen days have elapsed since their departure from Wuhan—longer than the 95th percentile estimate of the COVID-19 incubation period (Li et al., 2020; Linton et al., 2020)—there is very little probability that the five virus-positive asymptomatic individuals will develop symptoms. Should one of the five becomes symptomatic in the future, the overall asymptomatic ratio would decrease to 33.3% (95% CI: 8.3%, 58.3%). ....Estimation of the asymptomatic ratio of novel coronavirus infections (COVID-19), International Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020)....  Our estimated asymptomatic proportion is at 17.9% (95%CrI: 15.5–20.2%), which overlaps with a recently derived estimate of 33.3% (95% confidence interval: 8.3–58.3%) from data of Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan [13].....Estimating the asymptomatic proportion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, Yokohama, Japan, 2020, Eurosurveillance (2020)....
