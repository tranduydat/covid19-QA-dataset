Because "any" Coronavirus is so dangerous, much research have been done on viruses with similar properties. They are called "surrogates". Because nCoV is new, we don't have any studies, so we need to estimate it's behavior from previously studied similar viruses...Here:..RH   = Relative Humidity. .Tr   = Room Temperature.TGEV = Transmissible Gastroenteritis (surrogate).MHV  = Mouse Hepatitis (surrogate)...Viral survival for the TGEV/MHV surrogate:...on stainless steel:      4°C @ 20% RH:  28 days.in water/sewage (TGEV):  25°C: 22 days.in water/sewage (MHV):   25°C: 17 days.contaminated water is a potential vehicle for exposure if aerosols are generated...For airborne Human Coronavirus 229E (HCV/229E):...Optimal survival:  6°C @ 50% RH: .Poor* survival:     20°C @ "High" relative humidity (RH).(* "poor" in terms of 20°C but varying RH.)...For SARS CoV-P9:...Serum: 96 h = 4 days.Sputum &amp; Feces: 96 h = 4 days.Urine: 72 h = 3 days...For SARS-CoV (GVU6109):...in diarrheal stool (at low pH): 4 days.in respiratory/air droplets:  >7  days @ 20°C (Tr).in respiratory/air droplets:  >20 days @ 4°C....  "The main route of transmission of SARS CoV infection is presumed to be respiratory droplets. However the virus is also detectable in other body fluids and excreta. The stability of the virus at different temperatures and relative humidity on smooth surfaces were studied. The dried virus on smooth surfaces retained its viability for over 5 days at temperatures of 22–25°C and relative humidity of 40–50%, that is, typical air-conditioned environments. However, virus viability was rapidly lost (>3 log10) at higher temperatures and higher relative humidity (e.g., 38°C, and relative humidity of >95%).".  .  "We and others have reported that infectivity of SARS CoV (SARS coronavirus) was lost after heating at 56°C for 15 minutes but that it was stable for at least 2 days following drying on plastic.".....UPDATE: 2020-03-13..From [7]: ...
