On march the 16th (probably) the NHS held a press conference (Youtube Link) that includes (paraphrased)...  We need to &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;delay and weaken&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; the peak so the NHS would not be overflown...How? They didn't really explain the way behind delay and weakening the peak..Anybody could help?.
