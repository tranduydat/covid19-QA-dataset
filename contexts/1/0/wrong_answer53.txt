As you can see on the diagram below, oxygen solubulity in water drops by increasing temperature, so your fish has to breath more to get the same amount of oxygen......ref...You can find more info about why gas solubility is temperature dependent here:.Chemistry (Averill &amp; Eldredge) / Effects of Temperature and Pressure on Solubility..
