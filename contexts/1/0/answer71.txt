This includes "normal" infection, and I strongly doubt the strawberries will carry a lot more viruses than standard infections (see below). Only 5% of cases will have an incubation period shorter than 20 hours. Because they are distributed normally, it is very unlikely to have an incubation period of 3-6 hours, which is what you described......  It is important to wash all fruit and vegetables before you eat them to ensure they are clean and safe to eat..  Most people are aware of the importance of handling meat safely, but many consider the risk of food poisoning from vegetables to be low..  "It's a myth that a little bit of dirt doesn't do you any harm," says Dr Andrew Wadge, chief scientist of the Food Standards Agency (FSA)..  "Soil can sometimes carry harmful bacteria and, although food producers have good systems in place to clean vegetables, the risk can never be entirely eliminated.".  .  Source: NHS.uk...In the EU, imported fruits have a lot of regulations to match, and that they travel from the supplier to the consumer without being cleaned once is highly unlikely (still does happen sometimes, but highly unlikely). Because the gems can be quite devastating and infectious, on should always clean vegetables to prevent those to spread, but it doesn't seem too dangerous missing one out. ..Also, think about exponential growth. If the amount of viruses in your body were doubled every 2 hours (I don't have any numbers for that, but anything above seems unlikely), and your incubation time was 30 hours earlier than expected, you would have to have taken in 215 more viruses than the normally infected.....Most important:...  Since the virus is sensitive to pH and temperature, it replicates best below core body temperature and does not survive the acids found in the stomach, which means the virus does not infect the lower respiratory or gastrointestinal tract..  .  Source: Morgridge Institute for Research...This makes it even more unlikely, because the virus only has time to reach the nasal area until you've swallowed it.....Bottom line: Think about yesterday or the day before. With whom did you shake hands and touched your face afterwards without washing your hands? Who did you stand next to that had a running nose?.
