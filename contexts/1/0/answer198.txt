On desktop browsers one way to block this is using the uBlock origin extension. Right click after installing it, and select "block element". The element you want to block is:..###clarify-box &gt; .ytd-watch-flexy.style-scope...From your screenshot, it seems you are browsing youtube using the chrome web-browser, but with "Desktop site" enabled, is that right? If you turn that off it should not be displayed.
