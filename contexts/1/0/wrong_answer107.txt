On an elementary level, only very few grains of grasses do contain the protein complexes of the gluten group: Gliadin in Wheat, Hordein in Barley, Secalin in Rye, Avenin in Oats. On a 'processed' level gluten can be in a lot of products....  If experiencing gluten intolerance symptoms, the products on this page should be avoided.  Instead, concentrate on gluten free, brain healthy foods.  Many are listed here. This is sure to help maintain or improve brain health and function..  .

David Perlmutter: "Gluten Containing Products"...That is a long list to observe. And fortunately, that is only really necessary to observe strictly for celiac disease and allergies. For other reasons of observing gluten reduction we have to observe contradictory findings:...  In conclusion, our results indicate that for GF foods no predominant health benefits are indicated; in fact, some critical nutrients must be considered when being on a GF diet. For individuals with celiac disease, the GF database provides a helpful tool to identify the food composition of their medical diet. For healthy consumers, replacing gluten-containing products with GF foods is aligned with substantial cost differences but GF foods do not provide additional health benefits from a nutritional perspective..  Benjamin Missbach et al.: "Gluten-free food database: the nutritional quality and cost of packaged gluten-free foods", PeerJv.3; 2015, PMC4627916, DOI...On the other hand, practitioners seem to find – just like laypersons, trying it out – surprising improvements not by elimination of gluten, but by reducing gluten consumption. It's theorised that it's in this case not about the gluten, but accompanying substances called amylase-trypsin-inhibitors. These are quite understudied at the moment...Diagnostically, a differential between celiac (blood: anti-TG2, anti-DGP-antibodies), wheat allergy (blood: IgE-Ak), ATI-sensivity (no blood markers yet, but decline of chronic conditions), and FODMAP-intolerance has to be made.  ...  Detlef Schuppan &amp; Kristin Gisbert-Schuppan: "Tägliches Brot: Krank durch Weizen, Gluten und ATI", Springer: Berlin, 2018. (DOI)...If the aim of this inquiry is this 'reduction' in typical diets, than it is not really necessary to avoid gluten entirely in the long term..Nevertheless, the interest in these diets makes exact sources less important for non-celiac, non-allergy applications..And more important: they can vary a lot..Gluten in bread wheat is also much higher than in durum wheat for pasta.   ..Edurne Simón et al.: "Nutritional and Analytical Approaches of Gluten-Free Diet in Celiac Disease", SpringerBriefs in Food, Health, and Nutrition, Springer: Cham, 2017....  .

Due to the level of variation, if not given on a label of a concrete product, it will be giving the illusion of precision in an area of probably low importance where jst rough guides would suffice. ..To illustrate this, actual measurements from beer:...Malt type               Gluten (g kg^–1)a,c.Caraaroma (barley)       42.0 ± 0.2         .Melanoid (barley)        20.4 ± 0.2.Cararred (barley)        20.6 ± 0.2.Carafa (barley)          45.0 ± 0.2.Pilsner (barley)         18.8 ± 0.6 .Smoked (barley)          20.8 ± 1.0.Munich (barley)          20.2 ± 0.2.Wheat chocolate (Wheat)b 44.0 ± 1.6.Wheat pale (Wheat)b      68.0 ± 4.0.Spelt chocolate (Spelt)  21.2 ± 0.4.Rye chocolate (Rye)      41.6 ± 1.4..  .  a Mean ± standard deviation (n=3). b Sample analysed by Gliadin ELISA kit. c All samples, except wheat, were analysed by RIDASCREENÕ Gliadin kit...Gluten balance during brewing process.Product          Gluten (mg/kg^-1)    (%).Malt             18780                100.Sweet wort          49.4                1.75.Wort                48                  1.70.Beer                 6.0                0.21.Stabilised beer     &lt;3.0               &lt;0.11..  .
