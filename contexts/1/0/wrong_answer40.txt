Just expanding on aandreev's comment.....Polyadenylation is initiated by binding of CPSF (Cleavage and Polyadenylation specificity factor) after its binding to the AAUAAA motif..From the introduction of this article:...  CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation specificityfactor) binds to the.  AAUAAA hexamer via its 160-kDa subunit and possibly its 30-kDa subunit.  (Keller et al., 1991; Murthy &amp; Manley,1992; Jenny et al.,1994;.  Barabino et al.,1997). CstF (cleavage  stimulation  factor) binds to.  the U- or G/U-rich element downstream of the cleavage site, and.  stabilizes the binding of CPSF to the AAUAAA sequence of the pre-mRNA.  (reviewed in Colgan &amp; Manley,1997; Wahle &amp; Kuhn,1997)....Any alteration in the CPSF binding site will lead to reduced polyadenylation efficiency. Polyadenylation efficiency also depends on other factors such as secondary structure and presence of proximal CstF sites..
