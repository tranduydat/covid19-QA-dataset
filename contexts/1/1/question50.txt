I am trying to forecast aggregated daily COVID cases in Europe. These are present day numbers in Italy. ..temp &lt;- c(0    , 0    , 0  ,   0  ,   0   ,  0   ,  0  ,   0 ,    0,     2,. 2    , 2   ,  2 ,    2   ,  2 ,    2   ,  3  ,   3 ,    3,     3,. 3  ,   3  ,   3   ,  3  ,   3   ,  3,     3 ,    3   ,  3  ,   3,.20   , 62  , 155 ,  229 , 322  , 453   ,655  , 888,  1128 , 1694,2036 , .2502 ,3089 , 3858,  4636 , 5883 , 7375,  9172, 10149, 12462,12462)...My problem is that all the models underestimates the exponential growth patterns as this one with exponential smoothing. (if I try to predict using data until 4636 value, the different models estimates 8-9,0000 when the real number was 12,462). I have tried transformations, different models etc. ..library(data.table).library(tidyverse).library(forecast).library(lubridate)..COVfirst &lt;- min(which(temp &gt; 0))+22 #starts 22 day in january...temp2 &lt;- ts(temp, start = c(2020, 22), .            frequency = 365.25)..temp2 %&gt;% autoplot..test &lt;- ets(temp2,.            allow.multiplicative.trend =TRUE)...test %&gt;% forecast(., h = 14) %&gt;% autoplot()...ts_Italy_confirmed &lt;- temp2.forecast_italy_Confirmed &lt;- test %&gt;% forecast(., h = 14)...I a little confounded by this, because the development until present day is actually pretty straight forward (exponential). I don't like fitting a exponential regression model as this will not catch up when the exponential part of the epidemic stops. (I think).
