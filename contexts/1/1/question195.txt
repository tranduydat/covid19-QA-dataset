Covid-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has now been around since 3 months. European stock markets have crashed very hard, US-stock market has crashed hard, but the Chinese Stock market on the other hand seems to have not been affected by the whole thing at all...Hangseng Index (02.12.2019 - 31.03.2020): -10,74 %..Shanghai Composite Index (02.12.2019 - 31.03.2020): -4,36 %..Comparison:..Eurostoxx 50 Index (02.12.2019 - 31.03.2020): -23,62 %..S&amp;P 500 Index (02.12.2019 - 31.03.2020): -15,65 %..Why is that? Is it a sign that the European and US stock markets are overreacting?.
