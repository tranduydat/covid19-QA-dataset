Pictures like this can be taken with an electron microscope, where the effective wavelength of the illuminating beam is far shorter than that of visible light. Those pictures are in black &amp; white only (electrons don't have "color") but are then color-coded with tools like photoshop to highlight particular structures on their surfaces. ..Furthermore, once the exact structure of the protein molecules that form the virus has been figured out, molecular biologists can then apply computer models to the protein structures and determine with great accuracy how they fold together and interlock to create a complete virus particle. ..Those modeled structures can then be color-coded as well, again in the interest of highlighting where the different protein molecules are located and how they project out from the surface of the protein. ..The pictures you see of ball-shaped virus particles with lumpy, colored knobs studding their surfaces were prepared in this way. .
