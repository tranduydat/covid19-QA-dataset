Calcium phosphate crystallises in a number of different modifications of which &#x3b2;-$\ce{Ca3(PO4)2}$ is the stable room temperature and ambient pressure modification. It has a rather complex structure not easily described, consisting of chains and rings with phosphate and calcium ions in specific patterns. It is orthorhombic, but $c \gg b \approx a$...Any attempt to simplify its structure by drawing it in pseudocovalent depictions like your lower scheme is doomed to fail. Better just use the upper scheme; unless you are expected to know a certain saltâ€™s crystal structure that one is safe..
