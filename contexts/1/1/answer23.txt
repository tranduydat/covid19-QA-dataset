Governments have a significant interest in controlling pathogens and  preventing outbreaks: they are dangerous to dense &amp; unimmunized  populations.  ...  Can a government legally prevent me from intentionally infecting.  myself with a virus?...Yes, governments have the broad authority to enact laws.  The US prohibits  and regulates pathogen experimentation (self-infection). There are also rules regarding shipping and export (ITAR).  Furthermore, in the US, there are (FL, NY state) laws that prevent patients from being tested unless the order is given by an authorized health care professional.  Hopefully, you do live in a state that does not have this regulation (AZ)...While I do believe in one's right to do as one sees fit with one's own body, there is the counter-argument: there must be limits when it comes to unnecessarily exposing the community to pathogen risk.  I hope that this question is theoretical and that nobody actually believes the immunity supposition without a credible peer-reviewed scientific publication.  Unfortunately we live in an age where misinformation is propagated at novel speed and scale...I wish the OP well.  That being said, I have concerns regarding the underlying assumptions of the question.  While I am comfortable with the OP question, the underlying assumptions give me great pause...UPDATE..IMHO: I hope that no reader will seriously consider amateur experimentation in self-infection in the hope of conferring immunity. Giving a pathogen uncontrolled safe-haven to propagate and possibly infect others seems irresponsible...I doubt that the government cares if any individual manages to puts themselves in an early grave, however, it does care if amateurs create an unnecessary pandemic risk.   I would think that any government would view pathogen experimentation much like nuclear device experimentation, because of the mass casualty risk.  I hope that readers understand the implications of an amateur uncontrolled experiment..
