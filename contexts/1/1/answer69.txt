When working with mathematical models, it is always good to check the assumptions of the model. The logistic function is often used when modelling population growth, and specifically where the rate of reproduction is proportional to both the existing population and the amount of available resources, all else being equal. Letting $P$ represent population size, the differential equation is ..$$.{\displaystyle {\frac {dP}{dt}}=rP\cdot \left(1-{\frac {P}{K}}\right),}.$$.where the constant $r$ defines the growth rate and $K$ is the carrying capacity, see the link for more details. The solution, letting $P_0$ be the initial population, is.$$.P(t)={\frac {KP_{0}e^{rt}}{K+P_{0}\left(e^{rt}-1\right)}}.$$.Thus, this model would be appropriate if Italy did nothing to mitigate the spread of the virus, but they are in fact using quarantine. The effect of wrong modelling assumptions would be that if you cross-validated the fitted model, you would get poor results. ..Additionally, since the shape of the logistic function is ....and in your data, it does not seem to include the part where the curve flattens out, I would suspect that the parameter describing that phenomenon, $K$, would have a high variance from your estimation procedure. An intuitive explanation for this can be done by plotting the function for different $K$ and constant $r$:....In this figure, if there is only data for $t$ between 0 and 1 would not reveal so much information on $K$, other than if $K$ is around 10, compared to $K &gt; 100$. More formally, assuming you are doing maximum likelihood estimation, you can look at the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the corresponding likelihood function, to see if optimization problem is well conditioned. .
