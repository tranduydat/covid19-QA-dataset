You can use a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the variation of the parameters. Such method is explained in this blogpost https://blog.ephorie.de/contagiousness-of-covid-19-part-i-improvements-of-mathematical-fitting-guest-post ..Also you can estimate the variance of parameters based on the Fisher information matrix which can be approximated with the second-order derivative of an empirical likelihood function (based on your MLE and estimate of deviance). ..I am sure that there are several posts about this already on this Q&amp;A site. If you search for 'variance of parameter estimates' or something like that you might find out more..
