To prepare copper acetate absence H2O2, employ a known method from hydrometallurgy to process copper ore employing aqueous ammonia, air (a source of oxygen) and a small amount of salt (acting as an electrolyte for this, in part, spontaneous electrochemical reaction detailed below). This results in tetra-ammine copper hydroxide. The latter exists only in solution and upon evaporation yields CuO (and possibly some Cu2O also, see this old patent). Add an acid of choice (like vinegar, a source of acetate) to convert CuO into copper acetate. ..Related copper chemistry with ammonia and oxygen:..Cited half-reactions:..$\ce{1/2 O2 + H2O + 2 e- -&gt; 2 OH-}$ (cathodic reduction of O2 at surface of the Copper)..And, at the Copper anode, the formation of the complex:..$\ce{Cu + 4 NH3 + 2 H2O -&gt; [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2](2+) + 2 e-}$ (anodic dissolution of Cu by a complexing agent)..With an overall reaction:..$\ce{Cu + 4 NH3 + 1/2 O2 + 3 H2O -&gt; [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2](2+) + 2 OH-}$..Also, some interesting cited standard chemical reactions, where copper oscillates between cuprous and cupric states as noted by the source below:..$\ce{2 Cu + 4 NH3 + 1/2 O2 + H2O -&gt; 2 [Cu(NH3)2]OH}$..$\ce{2[Cu(NH3)2]OH + 4 NH3 (aq) + 1/2 O2 + H2O -&gt; 2 [Cu(NH3)4](OH)2}$..$\ce{Cu + [Cu(NH3)4](OH)2 &lt;--&gt; 2 [Cu(NH3)2]OH}$..Reference: "Kinetics and Mechanism of Copper Dissolution In Aqueous Ammonia" and a related work detailing reactions: ‘Copper Dissolution in Ammonia Solutions: Identification of the Mechanism at Low Overpotentials’, which is also a fully available PDF...Some alternate preparations would be to follow paths to copper patina (see this site, which discusses three paths for the home chemists which includes an embodiment of the ammonia prep, and, with the addition of vinegar, would convert the basic copper carbonate to copper acetate..
