Inspired by Avi's Vowelburger™ Riddle  ..Vowelburgers™ is proud to announce the first ever Penta-decker Vowelburger™. This means six consonant buns sandwiching five vowel patties as shown:....Here is the menu's description of their first burger:..$.\begin{gather}.% custom template - reuse if you may.\def\S#1#2{\Space{#1}{20px}{#2px}}\def\P#1{\V{#1em}}\def\V#1{\S{#1}{9}}.\def\T{\color{white}{\textbf{Layer}}}\def\NT{\color{white}{\textbf{Vowelburger}^{\;\!™}\ }}\displaystyle.\smash{\lower{29px}\bbox[#871c41]{\phantom{\rlap{rubio.2020.01.21-custom}\S{5px}{0}.\begin{array}{cc}\T&amp;\NT\\\end{array}}}}\atop\def\V#1{\S{#1}{5}}.\begin{array}{|c|c|}\hline\T&amp;\NT\\\hline.%.~\text{1}&amp;\text{passage 8}\\\hline.~\text{2}&amp;\text{poetry 7}\\\hline.~\text{3}&amp;\text{guide 9}\\\hline.~\text{4}&amp;\text{indirect 7}\\\hline.~\text{5}&amp;\text{rural 6}\\\hline.\end{array}\end{gather}$..Can you identify what type this burger is from the description on the menu?..Note: The full name of the penta-decker burger contains layers 1-5 from left to right...Hint:...   Eating the Penta-decker Vowelburger™ is like eating 5 regular* Vowelburgers™ merged with each other; in other words, the top of the first layer is the bottom of the next...*The word "regular" here means a bottom bun, single patty, and a top bun....Hint 2:...   Each layer comes with lots of add-ons; those add-ons will be discarded, though, since we don't want the burger to get too high. From each layer, we extract only the simple Vowelburger™ from the bottom. (Note: the bottom is the left side of the word.) ..
