You can't hold an investment directly in the "10 year treasury bond". You either buy an individual bond, say a 2007 bond maturing in 2017, or (most commonly) buy a bond fund that buys bonds for some time, then sells them and buys newer ones to maintain a range of maturities...So the comparison is between an S&amp;P500 fund (I used SPY) and a bond fund of average maturity around 10 years (I used IEF). Here's a link comparing performance during the crisis...Regarding what performs better than a 10-ish year treasury bond during a crisis, I'd say a longer treasury bond. There are maturities up to 30 years, and they did better during 2008 than shorter maturity bonds. However, those bonds expose you to significantly more fluctuations because of interest rate changes, so I'd avoid them unless you understand their risks..
