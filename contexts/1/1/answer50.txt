You can force ets() to use a model with multiplicative trend (and multiplicative error) by using the parameter model="MMN". Of course, you need to start the series later, since multiplicative trends and errors don't make sense for zero values...temp3 &lt;- ts(temp[-(1:9)], start = c(2020, 32), .            frequency = 365.25).test &lt;- ets(temp3,model="MMN").test %&gt;% forecast(., h = 14) %&gt;% autoplot().....I certainly hope this graphic is what you wanted...It also illustrates why ets() is very careful about fitting multiplicative trends on its own. They can and will explode. Also:...  I don't like fitting a exponential regression model as this will not catch up when the exponential part of the epidemic stops....Of course, ets() will not know when to stop extrapolating the exponential growth, so this (extremely correct) rationale applies equally to ets(). You may want to consider models that are explicitly tailored towards epidemiology or (market) penetration, like the Bass diffusion model or similar...EDIT: Rob Hyndman explains in more depth why smoothing and similar models do not make a lot of sense to forecast COVID-19, and gives pointers to more appropriate models. And here is Ivan Svetunkov..
