In the Queen's address to the Commonwealth on the Corona Virus, she says at 1:15:.."The pride in who we are is not a part of our past. It defines our present and our future.".What does the Queen mean by this? Is she saying that Britain does not have a past it can be proud of?..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2klmuggOElE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=115.
