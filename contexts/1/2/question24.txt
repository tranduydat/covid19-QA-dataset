The COVID-19 outbreak has been dominating the news recently, with loads of headlines and efforts being made to stop it from spreading...Why this disease? It's not one of the most lethal ones, or one of the deadliest. Compare:...COVID-19 - infected 24,478; deaths 492.Malaria - infected 228 million; deaths 405,000 (2018 data).Tuberculosis - infected 25% of world population, i.e. ~2 billion; deaths 1.6 million (2017 data).HIV/AIDS - infected 37.9 million; 1.7 million new cases a year; deaths 770,000 (2018 data)...Compared to malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, the COVID-19 outbreak is pretty much a rounding error...In terms of lethality, COVID-19 has a case fatality rate of 1.4-6.5%. This is still well below the lethality of tuberculosis (43%) and HIV/AIDS (80-90% after 5 years if untreated), although it is more lethal than malaria (~0.3%)..It seems like, objectively, COVID-19 is a very small fish in the pond of infectious diseases. It's not like the three diseases above are unique either; there're lots more diseases that affect &amp; kill more people than nCoV (e.g. measles, leishmaniosis). Yet, right now, when people die of COVID-19 they make the news, while thousands of people die of the other three diseases every day without getting a mention. Further, COVID-19 is apparently attracting lots of research efforts to treat it. Why is it being prioritized over other infectious diseases?..I'm looking for objective answers as to why COVID-19 matters so much..
