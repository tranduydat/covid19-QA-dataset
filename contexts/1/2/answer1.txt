There are a couple reasons:...You don't qualify. From your link:...  Distributions taken from qualified retirement plans received during 2020 of up to $100,000 for COVID-19 related purposes are allowed without a 10% penalty, taxable evenly over 3 years beginning with year of distribution, and may be recontributed within 3 years. Related purposes include a COVID-19 diagnosis for you, your spouse or dependent, and financial hardship as a result of business closures, reduced work hours, lay off, furlough, lack of child care or other factors as determined by the Treasury Secretary....If this doesn't apply to you, you can't do this anyway..Taxes. There is no penalty, but the withdrawal is still subject to taxes. You get to delay paying them, but they're at a higher rate than they would be if you withdrew at a slower rate and had no (or little) other income....Additionally, you say ...  Alternatively, we could put it into the S&amp;P 500 or Treasury bills, etc. ...You could do this inside your 401(k) without having to pay income taxes (at least until you actually withdraw)..
