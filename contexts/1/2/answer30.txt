Very little, practically speaking...From the WHO:...  "Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change WHO’s assessment of the threat posed by this #coronavirus. It doesn’t change what WHO is doing, and it doesn’t change what countries should do"-.  @DrTedros...As discussed in this Q&amp;A, the definition of "pandemic" is fairly arbitrary. It does identify this virus, both in the present day and in history, as particularly significant, but there is nothing magical that changes with this definition from a political (or epidemiological) perspective, and there appear to be no particular political consequences of the definition from the WHO's perspective...That is, there are no special funds or protocols that are activated by declaring a "pandemic" the way you might expect for various "declarations of emergency", which often activate laws that change regulations and procedures during the emergency and may allow for release of funds marked for that purpose...From the content of the announcement, it seems like the WHO's primary goal in making this declaration is to reiterate the severity of the situation rather than to mark any particular milestone or to alter any guidance or recommendations..
