This question is likely to get closed as opinion-based, but a few reference points:...Unless things get positively apocalyptic, it is exceedingly unlikely that Japan's airports would shut down completely.  Flights might be reduced, but as a comparison point, airports in China -- even in Wuhan -- have kept operating throughout the crisis there..On the inbound flight, this would require an infected person coming from Munich or London, which is statistically improbable.  On the way back, this is a higher possibility, but still unlikely unless (again) there's a major outbreak....FWIW, I was in Tokyo last week, and while it's not exactly panic in the air, people are definitely taking precautions: temperature scans at the airport, more masks than usual, hand washing &amp; sanitizers, large gatherings cancelled, etc .  This in itself seems likely to limit the spread of the virus, making full-blown contagion less likely.  But at the end of the day it's your call..
