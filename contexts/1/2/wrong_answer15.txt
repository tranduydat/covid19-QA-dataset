I think this plant is coffea arabica or the coffee plant. Not regularly found in the "assorted" bin it does make a handsome house plant if given the right conditions. In our location in the Northern Hemisphere it requires...bright diffuse light.cool temperatures ( &lt; 20 deg C) are better than hot.water thoroughly and let dry.this plant is sensitive to soil ph and will exhibit iron/manganese deficiency if given alkaline water. Try and maintain a soil ph of 6.5 or less  or use acid plant fertilizer once in a while...Identification key points:...glossy leaves come to a point.alternate leaves.veins on leaves are alternate.raised veins on the underside of the leaf.new stem growth is almost flat with a subtle groove down the midline..
