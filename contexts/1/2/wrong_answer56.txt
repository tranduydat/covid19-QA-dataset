I can't say if they are supporting them but they have some common interest . . . * . . . To sum it up, no they are not sympathizer of the Islamic State. They are mostly neutral toward them. -- Vincent ...This skips four good paragraphs by Vincent, so for more information I recommend reading the entire answer...Did Turkey take revenge of Russian attacks on ISIS by downing the plane?

Elaborate trade networks have also evolved, with oil being smuggled across borders in plastic jugs and transported by trucks and on donkeys into Iraq and Turkey. -- NY Times...IN SUMMARY: "It is an open question to what extent Turkey is deliberately allowing this to occur.".
