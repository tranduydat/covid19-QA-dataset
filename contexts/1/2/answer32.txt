There have been a number of reactions from the EU so far - some official, others not so much. I've decided, in the world of Twitter diplomacy, to count tweets from ministers and current/former heads of government as official responses for this purpose. Responses are in chronological order, culminating with the joint statement by President von der Leyen and President Michel...The first response from a current or former head of government came from former Finnish Prime &amp; Foreign minister, Alexander Stubb who tweeted at 5:18 UTC:...  Any attempt to contain the #CoronaOutbreak is welcome, but the.  decision of  @realDonaldTrump  to exclude the UK from a European.  travel ban is nothing short of irresponsible. Viruses do not recognise.  borders. Decisions should be based on facts, not politics....The European Council President, Charles Michel, then tweeted his initial response at 6:12 UTC, saying that...
