.First of all, IMHO this question can't be answered objectively, because no court has of yet ruled on whether the practice is legal. ..State court didn't hear any arguments on the topic, since the lawsuit filed by Pontiac had a radically different set of arguments...Federal circuit court basically threw the issue BACK to the state saying "we wash our hands off this", in the best tradition of political actors going back to Pontius Pilate :)......Second of all, House people are officially claiming that no laws or rules were violated (whether they are correct or not is, again, a question that a court has NOT yet answered)...The meat of the issue is, distilled, as follows:...MI state constitution allows some bills to be passed in the Legislature as "immediate effect" (I won't bother with the links or quotes - see CJR link below or lawsuit link above for details).This means the bill takes effect at passage, instead of 90 days later.This requires 2/3ds votes (super-majority) of both houses.The bills were being passed by a so-called "rising vote" voting (basically, the speaker guesses how many people voted "yay" and that's all she wrote), as opposed to roll call where every member's vote is recorded..Minority may request a vote to be roll call....BUTE, apparently, there seems to be some sort of technicality with how the roll call can be requested that basically allows majority to ignore the minority's request (minority must be called on to request... and majority doesn't have to call on them). Gotta LOVE politics..........Third of all, while Maddow tried to make it like some nefarious evil totalitarian power grab by Republicans (even throwing out stats like 90%+ of bills passed that way by Republicans)... subsequent second looks reveals that Democrats... did exactly the same thing. ...  Of the 761 bills passed when the Democrats had control of the House, 744 had “immediate effect.” (quoted by GOP press secretary, but confirmed by Columbia Journalism Review - not exactly a hotbed of conservatism).....For anyone who wants an in-depth and somewhat balanced look at the story, CJR's article seems to be a good starting point (http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/maddow_michigan.php?page=all&amp;print=true).
