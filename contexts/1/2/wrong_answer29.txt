My answer challenges the status quo mindset in the West (Russia bad, US &amp; West Europe good), so it might be a bit difficult to wrap your mind around it.....Putin made his thesis on energy - he knows what role energy plays in both geopolitics and overall economically both internally (for Russia) and globally. While the neocons have surrounded Russia militarily during the last 20 years, which is an existential threat, the control structures in the West have intentionally created an "everything bubble", forcing countries like Russia to give up their physical resources with imaginary "valuable" printed paper...What Putin did (and this is why Russia walked out of the OPEC negotiations) was speed up the pricking of the everything bubble - the low oil prices will force the 40% of the junk bond companies (such as shale oil companies) to go bankrupt, which is one of the many negative vortices in the future total reset of the global financial system...See also this YouTube channel regarding the future reset of the financial system, and this video explaining why Russia is threatened by the West..
