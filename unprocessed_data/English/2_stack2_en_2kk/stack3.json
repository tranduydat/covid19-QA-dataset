    "title": "Can 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic be a reason for refusal for my Schengen visa application?",
    "question": "I'm planning a trip to the Netherlands mid-April, and I've already made reservations. I understand that because of the current coronavirus pandemic, I may have to postpone my trip or cancel it entirely.\n\nHowever, instead of deciding now, I'd like to decide later (in April) if I should continue with my trip plans or cancel it (depending on travel advisories issued by my country (India) and the Netherlands, which would apply at that time). Which requires that I proceed with my visa application now (as I must apply at least 15 working days earlier). I understand that it is quite likely that I may have to cancel or postpone my trip (the global travel situation seems unlikely to get better by next month, but I want to stay optimistic, or at least not regret that I could have applied for visa in March if situations in mid-April do get favourable for a trip).\n\nMy concern is if the current coronavirus pandemic can be cited as a reason for visa refusal by the Netherlands embassy. I.e., does the current pandemic increase the likelihood of visa refusal when compared to normal circumstances? Are there any rules in visa policy of Schengen Area that concern with situations like this?\n\nUPDATE: To clarify, my concern here is if the current pandemic will increase the likelihood of visa refusal. (Whether or not I'll be able to travel to the Netherlands in April is a different issue). The reason I'm separating these two concerns is because with new EU visa rules, I may qualify for a long validity visa (as I've been issued multiple Schengen visas in past), so if in the unfortunate case I've to postpone my April trip, I can do so &amp; re-plan on a much shorter notice. Whereas if I don't apply for a visa now and do so later, I'll have to plan for weeks in advance again (as I must apply for a visa 15 working days / 3 weeks in advance).\n\nUPDATE: If the Netherlands issues a travel restriction in near future, will that result in a visa refusal or application rejection?\n",
    "answer_id": "154932",
    "answer": "There are restrictions in place, but AFAIK no current restrictions for Indian citizens/residents applying for Dutch visa. On the other hand, the Czech Republic closed their visa processing centers in China and Hong Kong several weeks ago, effectively preventing residents of China from applying for a Czech visa. It is at the moment difficult to predict what happens tomorrow or in the next days, but it is of course not impossible, that more Schengen countries will follow and impose restrictions on visa issuance.\n\nIndependent of the visa, it may also by mid-April be impossible to travel to the Netherlands. Several Schengen countries have today or in the past few days established very strict travel regulations or bans, effectively preventing many or most tourists and visitors from entering.\n",
    "answer_type": "Reasonable",
    "wrong_answer": "Whatever happens, if you apply right now, your chances of getting a visa will be best. If your application is rejected because of Coronavirus fears, that wouldn't be held against you in the future. \n\nObviously having a visa will not guarantee that you can enter the Netherlands. There might be no flights. \n",

    "question": "we were intending to travel to Norway ( more days) and Finland (2days) from 18.03.2020 till 1.04.2020. Now due to  the quarantine mandate issued by the Norway government to all foreign nationals entering Norway it's difficult to complete the norway part of our tour. we had a Finnair Flight via Helsinki to Norway and we were leaving from Helsinki after 2 days stay there. \nUnder this unusual situation is it possible that we do the entire tour in Finland without visiting Norway at all. Schengen visa has been issued by Norway.\nthis is an unusual situation as we will be compelled to be in quarantine irrespective of the health status in Norway. so there is no use in visiting the country. But we also do not want to cancel our plan. so checking out and need advice whether we can do the entire tour in Finland though originally Finland constituted a lesser part of our tour.\n",
    "answer_id": "154941",
    "answer": "I must say that nobody knows what's going to happen and that the situation is developing quickly in Europe.\n\nFirst I would suggest that you talk to your airline.  Normally if you miss a single segment then the whole rest of your trip (including your return) would be cancelled automatically.\n\nGiven the circumstances then the airlines are generally being very flexible, but you must first check what they will and will not allow and then change your itinery accordingly and not just not take a flight.  \n\nNext (or in parrallel) I would suggest contacting your local Finnish embassy and explaining the situation.  Tell them that your Schengen visa was issued by Norway, that you are flying via Helsinki anyway and would now like to spend the enture trip there rather than the couple of days you previously planned.  And then ask if they would, given the circumstances, allow you to enter and remain therer for xx days.\n\nIt really depends on how flexible they are.\nThey might allow this.  They might say that you should get a new visa issued.  They might reduce or waive the cost.  But you should check first.\n\nIf I was you, I would also consider making alternative plans.  Talk to the airline about rescheduling the trip, as it is likely that they will allow you to do this free of charge at the moment.\n\nOnly you can judge if this is a worthwhile trip for you given the cirumstances.\nMy personal opinion is that the next two weeks are going to get worse, and it will be awhile before the situation improves.  \n",

    "question": "You can read President Trump's full proclamation regarding conditions of travel between the US and Schengen zone here. Nowhere in this proclamation is a mention of a quarantine.\n\nHowever, several major news outlets seem to be reporting different (and contradictory) things.\n\nBBC reports: \n\n\n  Under President Donald Trump, the federal government has banned\n  non-citizens from coronavirus-hit regions entry, but US citizens are\n  allowed back into the country after a two-week quarantine.\n\n\nYet, CNN says \n\n\n  Returning travelers will be screened prior to entering the US and asked to self-quarantine for 14 days.\n\n\nMy question is, which is it? Will people exempt by the restriction face a mandated quarantine at the airport, or be told to self-quarantine? Nowhere in the official proclamation do I see mention of screening (which I am all for). If one of these people who is exempt from the restriction passes the screening (negative for the virus), are they free to go?\n",

    "answer": "According to the DHS announcement and fact sheet, the procedures for people who have been to Schengen Area countries within the last 14 days who are exempt from the ban (US citizens, permanent residents, and their immediate family members) are the same as the procedure for people who have been to Mainland China (but haven't been to Hubei province) or Iran within the last 14 days.\n\nBasically, they will have to arrive in the US at one of 13 designated airports, where they will undergo medical examination. If they have no symptoms, they will be asked to self-monitor their health and limit interactions (the government also calls this \"self-quarantine\") until 14 days after they have left the Schengen Area, but there are no formal restrictions on where they can go.\n\nOnly people who have been to Hubei province within the last 14 days are subject to a formal, mandatory quarantine so far.\n",

    "title": "Can I get a refund for COVID-19 related cancellations?",
    "question": "In the current situation, many people will have to cancel existing flight or hotel bookings, and would like to get a refund.\n\nIn which cases can one get a refund?\n",
    "answer_id": "155055",
    "answer": "There are many specific rules which will vary based on at least:\n\n\nthe country where the property or airline is based\nthe point of departure or the destination of the flight\nthe country where you reside\nthe original cancellation terms of the booking\nwhether you bought flights and hotels separately or not\nwho you bought the flights and/or hotel from\nwhether they were bought as part of group bookings / blocks\nother specific details.\n\n\nBut, in general, the following apply:\n\n\nIf your flight is cancelled by the airline, then you should in general be eligible for a refund.\n\n\nFor flights covered by the EU Flight Compensation Regulation EC261/2004, i.e. all flights departing from an EU/EEA member state or operated by an airline based in an EU/EEA member state, this is explicitly stated in Article 8 of the regulation.\n\nGiven that there are exceptional circumstances, no compensation is due. However, you must still be given the option of a refund, though one can accept rerouting or rebooking.\n\nAs airlines are cash-strapped, they will try to convince you to take a voucher instead of a refund. You can agree to it if you want, but they cannot force you to do so. Remember that many airlines will fail due to this situation. A failed airline cannot honour a voucher or a rebooking (though it's quite probable quite a few will fail before owed refunds are paid).\n\nAirlines are required to refund you within 7 days. Given the very large number of queries they are receiving at this time, and the precarious financial situation they are in, it will probably take much longer, though, and in many cases any appeal will take enough time for the airline to have failed before you get paid.\nFor other cancelled flights not covered by EC261, the rule should be the same (they couldn't provide the service, so they should provide a refund), but this will be governed by local laws and/or the airlines terms &amp; conditions (conditions of carriage).\nNote that several other countries implement rules very similar (or even identical) to EC261, including Turkey, Georgia, Moldova, Serbia and Ukraine.\nNote that you should only ask for the refund if you are at home. If you are stranded in a foreign country, getting a refund may complicate things a lot to secure alternate travel. Though EC261 requires the airline to provide both the refund and a return flight \"at the earliest opportunity\", in many cases the return flight you want may not be operated by the airline but via some other scheme.\n\nIf however your flight has not (yet) been cancelled, and you decide to change your plans, then you do not have the right to a full refund (unless the fare was fully refundable, of course). In theory, the original terms of your fare should apply (including fares being non-refundable, penalties, etc.). Most airlines will however offer to either rebook for free or provide a voucher valid for future travel (usually valid for a year). Note that in many cases, the rebooking options or voucher validity will be limited to one year from the original purchase date. I doubt any will offer a refund in this case.\n\nThis applies also if you change your plans because the situation at the destination is no longer suitable, or you will not be able to get to your hotel, or the conference or event you were planning to attend has been cancelled, or you are stuck in yet another country due to the current travel restrictions, etc. As long as it's not the airline cancelling the flight, no refunds are due.\nThe case of countries suddenly closing their borders to some categories of people (e.g. the US refusing entry to anyone having gone through the Schengen Area, UK, or Ireland in the past 14 days) probably falls in the last category: as long as the flight still operates, the airline usually is not required to provide a refund.\nAirlines will often proactively suggest you rebook your travel or get a voucher. Once you have accepted that option, you are no longer eligible for a refund even if the flight you originally booked ends up being cancelled.\nFor hotels, the rules are basically the same, though I'm not aware of any blanket legislation like EC261:\n\n\nIf the hotel cancels the booking (because they will be closed or completely inaccessible), you should in general be eligible for a refund, even if the fare was non-refundable.\nIf the hotel is still able to honour your booking, but you just can't get there (because there are no flights, borders are closed, you're stuck in another country, region or city) or no longer want to get there (you no longer want to travel, the event you wanted to attend has been cancelled...), then you are in general not eligible for a refund.\n\nHere again, the hotel may apply the original rules of the booking (no refunds or changes at all), or they can (and many will) allow for a rebooking at a later date or a voucher. But ultimately, that is their choice.\n\nTravel booked as a \"package\" (flight + hotel, sometimes other components as well) sold by a travel agent or tour operator usually have additional protections, especially those sold by EU companies. Most importantly, if the flight is cancelled or the hotel at the destination is unreachable/closed, one is eligible for a refund of the whole package, whereas when both are booked separately, one may be able to get a refund for one but not the other.\nAdded 18/3/2020 In some places, the government has changed the rules, and explicitly authorises some actors to not refund, and instead only provide a voucher valid for one year. See this answer for Belgium for such an exemple.\n\n\nLet's add that this is were travel insurance should come into play, but double-check any exclusions and conditions that may apply. Also, don't forget that you may have multiple travel insurances: many credit cards have a travel insurance automatically included for all travel bought using the card. Check the conditions and exclusions of any that may apply (you can of course only get refunded by a single one).\n",

Most weren't exactly as shown on your link, and some (for example on a local market in Cebu) didn't have running water (there's a bucket of water nearby and you flush with a ladle), but it didn't look or felt filthy.

Even paid toilets sometime (not always) had only tissues, and usually for extra fee - although minor.\n\nAnd as you guess, pay toilets and those closer to touristy areas are generally cleaner and more stocked.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "This happens quite regularly for multi-carrier trips. Less so for single carrier trips.\n\nAirline search algorithms are often inferior\n\nFor single carrier trips, it's almost always because the airline's search algorithm doesn't find the trip you want, not because the airline doesn't sell it.\n\nIf the search tool is an in-house product, it may be inferior in an absolute sense compared to something like ITA's QPX search, which many OTAs now use. Writing a search algorithm for airline flights is a terrifically hard problem (formally it is classed as \"undecidable\"), and airlines don't hire the kind of computer scientists who can solve it efficiently. Specialists like ITA have hundreds of computer scientists.\n\nAlternatively, an airline's search may be tuned with different preferences to an OTA. A lot of airlines try to avoid overnight stops, even if that would be preferable to three flights at a higher price. I would guess that's the cause of your SAS problem here.\n\nSolutions\n\n\nTry the multicity search, and put some of the connecting cities in as if they were stopovers. When you choose the dates, choose the dates that you'll actually fly that leg. This is often a good bet, but it sometimes causes the airline to price your trip with a fare break point at the stopover (i.e., as a sum of one way fares instead of a single through fare): Iberia.com is particularly terrible for this shortcut. However, I notice SAS has helpfully removed its multicity feature as part of the dumbing down exercise that makes the rest of its webpage unusable on a real computer.\nBookwithmatrix or Google Flights can sometimes link you directly to the desired itinerary on the airline's site. (If you do this on aa.com, you'll find that you get kicked out at the payment stage if your credit card's address isn't in the United States. But it turns out AA doesn't actually validate the country field, so you can just leave it set to United States.)\nCall the airline, tell them what flight numbers you want to fly, and give them the price you expect. There is usually a telephone booking fee for doing this, although if you have some status with the airline it might be waived, particularly if you explain their website was not good enough to do it online. I used to have a friend at the Amsterdam ticketing desk for British Airways. In what I consider a crowning achievement some years ago, I constructed a price for a trip from information on expertflyer.com that was 50% lower than his system or any OTA admitted, and after some back and forth with revenue management, he agreed it was a bug in their pricing system and sold me the itinerary at the lower price. :-)\n\n\n\n  (and if so, would this be standard practice, or should I expect it to be hit and miss depending on the airline?)\n\n\nBA, AA, KLM, 90% success rate, sometimes have to hang up and call again. Qantas, JAL, Cathay Pacific, their telephone staff and ticket desks are always reliable. Air France, maybe 50%. Iberia, Alitalia, LATAM: total waste of time. \n\nPoint-of-sale differences in inventory\n\nSometimes, additional inventory is available in the city where the travel agent is based, compared to where the airline is calculating the price. To understand why that can be the case, you should know that \"how many seats left for sale on a plane\" is a function of the sales city as well as other factors. Airline websites, in my experience, usually price from the city of origin, whereas agents usually price from a fixed point. One way to see this is from the payment currency, which will invariably be the currency of the sales city. For instance expedia.fr prices out of Paris, regardless of whether the itinerary passes through that city.\n\nThis only seems to matter when the flight is filling up.\n\nTicket issuance restrictions in the fare\n\nSometimes, the airline really cannot sell you the trip. This may be because the trip comprises multiple fares and one of the fares has a restriction that it must be issued \"on the stock\" of a ticket airline. Stock here refers to the old fashioned 4-part carbon paper tickets, but the concept is directly implemented in electronic ticketing. For instance, looking at a cheap S7 fare from London to Yekaterinburg:\n\nCategory 15: Sales restrictions\n  TICKETS MUST BE ISSUED ON S7.\n         NOTE -\n          SALES PERMITTED ON TICKET STOCK VALIDATED OR\n          PLATED S7/421 ONLY.\n\n\nEven though a BA plane will fly you the first leg from London to Moscow, BA could not sell you a journey involving this particular fare. Airlines always sell tickets on their own \"paper\", not as agents for another airline; in this case, BA sells tickets on BA plate (ticket number starting \"125-\") and S7 sells tickets on S7 plate (ticket number starting \"421-\"). But a travel agent could pick any validating carrier with whom it has a ticketing agreement, subject to the fare rules and the agreement. So the travel agent has some additional flexibility. \n\nThis really only matters when you have a particularly complicated trip with multiple airlines who don't partner together very closely.\n",

    "question": "I'll try and make it short. My spouse will be arriving at an airport in Germany from a Non-EU country outside Europe and she will need documents, which I have in original, in order to pass, given COVID-19 restrictions. Normally she would enter on a 90 days tourist visa, as we don't yet have a long term family reunification visa. \n\nHow can I reach the border control at the airport, in order to hand her/help her at the border, with the required document in original, in order for her to be allowed to enter as my spouse?

We planned for me to go to her and then come back together. COVID-19 really messed things up.\nI did think I could send the documents to her by post, but that feels extremely ridiculous given that I can wait for her with the documents at the airport + It would be very very concerning, if the originals get lost in the post, given the chaos caused by COVID, as her country is on the other side of the world from Germany.\n\n\nEdit - Appreciate all the answers. \n\nI've reached out to the relevant Bundespolizei and their answers are very cautious in this new world. I've sent out via 3 separate e-mails and received more ore less the following answer back from all 3: \"without a residence permit, third-country nationals are not allowed to enter the country for the next thirty days. To what extent an exception is possible in your situation cannot be answered at the moment. In the course of your personal responsibility you/your wife should generally refrain from travelling!\" So they have no clue how to address this. We've sent e-mails to the German embassy as well, to see if we can clarify via themselves, since the BP are asking for a residence permit or some kind of visa, where none should be required in the case of a EU Nationals' wife and which we can really only get in Germany now, since all relevant documents are here with me. \n",

    "answer": "\n  Normally she would enter on a 90 days tourist visa, as we don't yet have a long term family reunification visa.\n\n\nYour wife will never get a long-term family reunification visa because such visas are not issued to beneficiaries of the free movement directive.\n\nAs a beneficiary from a so-called \"Annex II\" country (that is, a country whose citizens do not need a visa for short visits), your wife is supposed to enter without a visa and then apply for a residence card after entering Germany.\n\nThe trick, of course, is to find specific information about how the travel ban is being applied to non-EU citizens who enjoy freedom of movement through a family relationship but who do not yet reside in Germany.  This may be difficult as the number of such cases is probably small and the possibility may not have been considered by the people writing the policies.\n\nthe best I have been able to find so far is at https://www.germany.info/us-en/coronavirus/2317268 (emphasis added):\n\n\n  EU-citzens and citizens of Great Brtain, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland and their family members will be allowed to transit through Germany to reach their home countries.\n\n\nThis suggests that beneficiaries of the free movement directive are included among those who may enter Germany.  Your wife might want to say that Germany is her place of residence (which is arguably true) but that she hasn't yet lived there long enough to get a residence card (which is certainly true).  Alternatively, she should call the German authorities and ask them what to tell the airline.  To that end, see How to contact border authorities in EU/Schengen countries? on this site.\n\nRegarding the documents, you might try asking the airline if they will pass them to her when she gets off the plane.  My wife was in a similar situation recently, and that was the solution.\n\nPart of this process was that the airline employee in the destination airport made a note in the airline's system that the documents were sufficient.  This was necessary for her to be able to board the plane without having the documents with her.  This may also prove necessary in your wife's case.\n",

    "question": "I am trying to travel to Austria from Brussels by train, and have conflicting information on the status of cancellations due to Covid-19.\n\nAccording to Eurail, \"all rail services from Germany to Austria are cancelled until further notice\"\nhttps://www.eurail.com/en/help/travel-disruptions/coronavirus-update\n\nYet, Deutsche Bahn and the 'trainline.eu' both allow me to book high-speed ICE trains across the border, just not the Nightjet trains. There are notices saying that there are delays/reduced services expected at the border, but it is not impossible to book like it is for other trains.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\ndoes this mean that it is still possible to take the high-speed ICE trains?\nif not, is there any other way that it is permitted to travel over the German border to Austria (e.g. by bus, coach or taxi)?

Since the site doesn't mention ICE trains between Germany and Austria, I assume they are still running.\n\nIn case the trains stop running before you make it to Austria: If you are eligible to enter Austria, nothing should stop you from entering by taxi (or, taking a taxi to the german side of the border, crossing the border by foot, ordering another taxi to pick you up at the austrian side of the border) - but depending on how close to the border you can get by train this can be quite expensive. \n\nI wouldn't count on buses or coaches: They have never been quite as popular as trains, and the one company that offered (more or less) regular coach services - Flixbus - stopped operations tonight due to corona. \n",

    "answer_id": "155225",
    "answer": "CWOP stands for cancelled without prejudice.  The phrase without prejudice means that the reason for cancellation is not to have a negative impact on your future applications for visas or for admission to the US.\n\nTherefore, you ought to be able to apply for a new visa.  However, I am not sure what the rules are surrounding OPT (for that, you should ask at Expatriates), so there may be something going on with that that would prevent it.\n\nThe odd thing here, however, is that visas are usually cancelled without prejudice in response to some sort of administrative action.  For example, when one applies for a new visa before the old one is expired, the old visa will be cancelled without prejudice.  A visa cancellation while the bearer is en route to the US would normally be a cancellation with prejudice, because the bearer has been found inadmissible for some reason.\n\nOn the other hand, if you were prevented from flying to the US because of the travel ban related to COVID-19, I would think that your visa should not have been cancelled at all.\n\nSo I wonder whether there is some additional fact that you haven't mentioned that might explain exactly what happened.

    "wrong_answer": "After seeing my comment on this question, @GayotFow shared his view of the issue via his blog, about the refusal of your fiancés Marriage Visitor Visa (MVV).  \n\n\n  The OP is a British national whose fiance is in India and they want to use an MVV for the fiance to come the UK and get married.  This throws up a flag right off the bat…\n  \n  Background.  The MVV was invented in 2005 because Parliament found a no other way to accommodate a specific scenario:  A couple where both parties were non-EU nationals want to come to the UK and get married at a destination venue (such as a romantic castle in Scotland) and then leave the UK. The hospitality lobby had successfully argued that without a visa like this the hotel and catering industry would suffer a loss of revenue. So this visa was created and enacted.\n  \n  British nationals who want to marry a non-EU spouse are meant to use the existing fiance visa rules given in Appendix FM.  But these rules have a hefty fee attached to them and therein lies the confusion.  People look at the various options and see that a UK fiance visa fee is about GBP 1,500, whereas the fee for an MVV is only about GBP 90.  So the MVV is obviously the way to go, right?\n  \n  Well, no.  The fiance visa gives the holder the right to stay in the UK lawfully once the couple are married and then to apply from within the UK for a spouse visa. The holder of a spouse visa can take employment, and receive permanent residence (indefinite leave to remain, or ILR) after 5 years. And then they can apply for British nationality on the next day!  The holder of an MVV gets none of those things.\n  \n  But for some, it’s worth the difference in price to come to the UK, get married, and then use Article 8 (human rights) to remain in the UK.  When this happens, the path to ILR is extended to 10 years. Of course the applicant’s credibility is stained, but for lots of people this aspect doesn’t mean very much as they are just starting out in life.  I have been saying that it may be worth it for a very small number of cases, but 10 years is an awfully long time to hold out in a perilous immigration status with a new marriage. But if it works, it works, right?\n  \n  Well, sort of. But if the strategy is to get in cheaply and to use Article 8, then the SVV costs the same and leaves their credibility largely intact, or at least more so than the outright abuse of an MVV.\n  \n  Anyway, back to topic…\n  \n  Reading the refusal notice I find myself repeating the mantra that “ECO’s are not idiots”. Here we have two people who want to get married. Option 1 is to send the Brit to India, get married, and return to the UK. Option 2 is to send the Indian to the UK, get married, and (optimistically stated) return to India.  Any way you cut it Option 1 is somewhere between GBP 300 – GBP 400 cheaper than Option 2.  So what’s the rationale for wanting Option 2?  How is it that somebody with GBP 169 in the bank proposes to spend 300 – 400 pounds more to accomplish the same thing? Unless it’s to accomplish something different.  Or is the ECO not supposed to notice those things?  I suppose there’s an explanation that justifies an irrational plan like that, but they didn’t include it in the application.\n  \n  Next we come to the point Giorgio raised… they instructed a solicitor, this is great and part of my standing advice for over two decades.  So what in heaven’s name are they doing on the net asking random strangers for ideas and advice?  eh? EH?\n  \n  Finally (and perhaps mercifully) we arrive at my final nitpick.  In comments, the OP writes…\n  \n  \n    He would be arriving in March, or the end of February (depending on if the application is approved) and we would leave for India together at the end of April/beginning of May as he has examinations in May\n  \n  \n  Let’s do the arithmetic. 7 days residency required in order to give notice plus 28 – 70 days for the notice period (more if something is turned up).  That gives us somewhere between 35 to 77 days before the marriage can take place. Then add 3 – 5 days slippage to book the celebrant. His exams in India start in May.  The rest is left as an exercise for the reader.\n\n\nBottom line: as a UK citizen, use of this route is abusive, which a solicitor versed in UK immigration law will recognize. A second application in the same category will likely have the same result, a refusal, and repeated refusals affect him, not you. For your future together, you may need to rethink your short term plans so that your long term goals are not affected negatively.\n",

    "answer_id": "155290",
    "answer": "To understand what it means, let's unpack the text of the decision.\n\n\n  Sufficient justification for the purpose and circumstances of the intended stay was not provided.\n\n\nThat's one of the standard reasons for refusals provided in the Schengen Visa Code and other official documents. In general, it means that the consulate is not convinced you have a valid purpose for travel. There are many reasons why that might be and the rest is just an explanation of how they reached that conclusion.\n\n\n  The specific purpose for which the visa was applied for is no longer valid or will cease to be valid before you arrive in the member state of destination.\n\n\nThis one is more specific and should help understand the first one. What this means is that the purpose for the trip you described in your original application might have been valid at some point in the past but it is not current anymore. Imagine you want to attend a conference but your application is delayed and the date of the conference has passed by the time the application is being assessed. Going to a conference is a perfectly valid purpose for a trip but if that specific conference has passed, you cannot possibly attend it and it's not a valid purpose for a visit anymore. \n\nIt's difficult to say more without knowing more about your application but there are currently many restrictions on entry, travel and access to public areas across Europe due to the Covid-19 pandemic. So there are many legitimate trips to the Schengen area that are just not possible anymore. For example, if you applied for a visa to vacation in Italy, providing hotel bookings, etc. your trip does not have a purpose anymore as it won't be possible for you to stay at these hotels or visit any sights.\n\n\n  No other (secondary) purpose was stated at the time of the application, [or] if it was, insufficient documentation was provided to demonstrate the purpose of the stay. \n\n\nA single journey can very well have several purposes. Even if one of them ceases to be valid, it doesn't mean that the trip is necessarily useless. But, in the judgment of the consular officer, you did not describe any other sufficient purpose for this journey. It could be a reference to some detail of your application or simply some boilerplate they add to all such decisions.\n\n[Note: I changed “of“ into “or”. It makes more sense in this sentence; it could be a simple typo or a confusion with the Dutch word “of“, which does mean “or”.]\n\nSo what does it mean for you? The decision is negative, you won't get a visa and cannot travel at this time. An appeal does not seem to make sense to me so you will need to start a new application from scratch if you want to travel to the Schengen area in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, that's not the worst reason to be refused a visa. Nothing suggests the consular officer suspected that you might be lying (they can use a different phrasing - “the justification […] was not reliable” in that case) and they haven't expressed any doubt regarding your personal situation and willingness to abide by the rules. So a new application in a few months from now, when Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted, seems like it would have good chances to be successful.\n",
    "answer_type": "Reasonable",
    "wrong_answer": "It should not be a problem.\n\nThe relevant condition for applying for a Schengen visa is just that you're legally resident in the coverage area for the consulate you're applying to. It is perfectly possible to be legally resident in the USA without having a current visa, and consulates in the USA know this well.\n\nAnother possible problem is that the consulate want to be sure you can actually leave the Schengen area when you say you will. That could have been a problem if your plan was to return to the US directly, since you don't have a visa that would allow you to board a plane.\n\nBut in your case your plan is to go to India when you leave the Schengen area, and presumably you already have all the paperwork you need for that (namely, a valid Indian passport), so there's no doubt that you will be able to do so.\n\nIf problems with getting your new US visa develop, it will be after you've left the Schengen area, so that's not a risk the Schengen consulate would care about.\n\nYou will still need to show that you have plans for your future that would seem more attractive than \"stay in Europe as an illegal immigrant\", but simply documenting a well-reasoned expectation that you will get an US visa when you reach India ought to take care of that.\n",

    "answer_id": "155334",
    "answer": "TL;DR: You can, possibly, in some places, but it may not be a great idea.\n\nWhether it is legal depends on the Bundesland (state) — to put it simply, the federal government has no authority in these matters, and each state put down their own rules. There are federal rules for entry into Germany, but these don't apply as you are already in the country.\n\nExample rules\n\nFor example: In Saarland they implemented a lockdown (possibly due to their proximity to the heavy-hit regions of France): You may only leave your home due to \"important reasons\". On the other hand Rheinland-Pfalz has a \"contact prohibition\", which means that you can free to go wherever you want, as long as you are with no more than one other person. \n\nAlso, individual cities have the right to be more restrictive.\n\nThings change\n\nCase numbers will rise in Germany and regulations may become more strict at any moment. In which case it may be difficult for you to go back home (also: Do not count on any restrictions being lifted until well after Easter — at best)\n\nInfrastructure is shut down\n\nHowever, even in Rheinland-Pfalz accommodations are not open for touristic purposes. This will include campgrounds. \"Wild\" camping is only regulated by the Länder, but generally there will be restrictions, and camping spots may be cordoned off. \n\nAlso, most public services that are useful for travellers are also shut down.\n\nEnforcement\n\nIt is difficult to say how things will be enforced. Generally there's no formal requirements in Germany, unlike in Italy or France. They will still stop and fine you if you blatantly flout the rules. My guess is that nobody will go and check for wild camping in the middle of nowhere, but they may check popular camping spots to make sure people don't congregate there.\n\nResponsibility\n\nCycling alone is not really an (additional) risk, as long as you don't meet people. However, the question is if it is going to be a fun trip if you\n\n\ncan't go in places like the Saarland,\nkeep to yourself all the time,\nhave to find a remote spot to pitch your tent each night, and have no access to sanitary facilities,\nhave to bring/buy and cook your own food (there will be no restaurants).\n\n\nPlus, Germany is a densely populated country — it will be hard to really be alone. And as soon as more than one person pitches their tent in one place, the police will likely see that as a \"congregation\" and break it up. \n\nIn all honesty, it is probably a better idea to stay put in one place. If the local laws allow it, you can still go cycling and return to your home each night.\n",

    "answer": "She can file Form I-539 for Extension of Status at any point up until her status expires. The application just has to be officially received by USCIS before her status expires.\n\nIf she filed her Extension of Status application before her status expired, she can stay in the US while it is pending even if her status expires in the meantime. The government will generally not deport her for being out of status while her Extension of Status is pending. In addition, she does not accrue \"unlawful presence\" while her timely-filed, non-frivolous Extension of Status application is pending, even if her I-94 is expired. If her Extension of Status is approved, she will be retroactively granted status from when her last status expired.\n\nSee this brochure:\n\n\n  What if I file for an extension of stay on time but USCIS doesn’t make\n  a decision before my I–94  expires?\n  \n  Your lawful nonimmigrant status ends, and you are out of status, when\n  your Form I-94 expires, even if you have timely applied to extend your\n  nonimmigrant status.  Generally, as a matter of discretion, USCIS will\n  defer any removal proceedings until after the petition is adjudicated\n  and USCIS decides your request for extension of nonimmigrant status.\n  [...]\n  \n  Even though you are not actually in a lawful nonimmigrant status, you\n  do not accrue “unlawful presence” for purposes of inadmissibility\n  under section 212(a)(9)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,\n  while your extension of status application is pending if it was filed\n  prior to the expiration of your Form I-94.\n  \n  [...]\n  \n  If your application for an extension of stay is approved, the approval\n  will relate back to the date your Form I-94 expired, and your status\n  while your application is pending will then be considered to have been\n  lawful.\n  \n  If your application is denied, you may be required to cease employment\n  and depart the United States immediately.\n  \n  In addition, any nonimmigrant visa in your passport granted in\n  connection with your classification becomes void. Once your visa is\n  void, you must submit any new visa application at a U.S. consulate in\n  your home country (not a third country, except in rare instances as\n  determined by the U.S. Department of State).\n\n\nIf her timely-filed, non-frivolous Extension of Status application is denied, and her I-94 has expired, and she is still in the US on the date of the denial, she will start to accrue \"unlawful presence\" from the date of the denial. \n\nSee AFM chapter 40.9.2(b)(3)(D)(iv):\n\n\n  If a timely filed, non-frivolous request for EOS or COS is denied for\n  cause, unlawful presence begins to accrue the day after the request is\n  denied.\n\n\nAnd 9 FAM 302.11-3(B)(1)(b)(4)(b)(ii):\n\n\n  b. DHS has interpreted \"period of stay authorized by the Secretary of\n  Homeland Security,\" as used in this context, to include:\n  \n  (4) For aliens who have applied for extension of stay or change of\n  nonimmigrant classification and who have remained in the United States\n  after expiration of the From I-94 while awaiting DHS's decision, the\n  entire period of the pendency of the application, provided that: \n  \n  (a) the alien does not work unlawfully while the application is\n  pending and did not work unlawfully prior to filing the application;\n  and\n  \n  (b) the alien did not otherwise fail to maintain his or her status\n  prior to the filing of the application (unless the application is\n  approved at the discretion of USCIS and the failure to maintain status\n  is solely a result of the expiration of the Form I-94), and further\n  provided either:\n  \n  (i) [...]; or\n  \n  (ii) if the application was denied or the alien departed while the\n  application was still pending, that the application was timely filed\n  and nonfrivolous.\n\n\n\"Unlawful presence\" doesn't cause a ban unless she leaves the US after accrues more than 180 days of \"unlawful presence\". So she shouldn't have to worry about a ban as long as she leaves within a reasonable amount of time after she learns about the denial.\n\nThe other consequence of her being still in the US when her Extension of Status is denied if her I-94 is expired, is that INA 222(g) is triggered, which means the visa she used to enter the US is automatically voided, and she would have to apply for US visas from her country of nationality from then on.\n\nAlso, USCIS has a policy where they will issue Notices to Appear (NTAs) to people after an I-539 denial if they are unlawfully present after the denial, although I am not sure whether they are still doing that during the COVID-19 outbreak. According to this teleconference, they will wait for a 33-day period (the period to file a Motion to Reopen or Reconsider) after the denial before they issue the NTA, so this basically means your mother should try to leave within 33 days of a denial.\n\nOn the other hand, if she leaves the US while her timely-filed, non-frivolous Extension of Status application is still pending (i.e. before it is approved or denied), she does not accrue any \"unlawful presence\", and her visa is not voided.\n\nSee AFM chapter 40.9.2(b)(3)(C):\n\n\n  Departure from the United States while a request for EOS or COS is\n  pending, does not subject an alien to the 3-year, 10-year, or\n  permanent bar, if he or she departs after the expiration of Form I-94,\n  Arrival/Departure Record unless the application was frivolous,\n  untimely, or the individual had worked without authorization.\n\n\nAnd the 9 FAM 302.11-3(B)(1)(b)(4)(b)(ii) passage quoted previously.\n\nAnd it does not void her visa under INA 222(g), according to 9 FAM 302.1-9(B)(1)(c)(4)(B):\n\n\n  [...] In addition, if an alien departs after the date on the Form I-94\n  passes, but before his or her application for extension or change of\n  status has been decided by USCIS, they must be subject to a blanket\n  exemption from INA 222(g), if the application was filed in a \"timely\n  manner\" and is \"nonfrivolous\" in nature.  You may consider an\n  application nonfrivolous if it is not, on its face, a groundless\n  excuse for the applicant to remain in the United States to engage in\n  activities incompatible with his or her status.  Posts may be\n  satisfied that an alien filed in a timely manner using evidence such\n  as a record in USCIS Person Centric Query Service (PCQS) or the dated\n  receipt or canceled check from USCIS for the payment of the\n  application fee to extend or change status together with evidence of\n  the expiration of the alien's legal status.\n\n\nThe meaning of being timely-filed and non-frivolous are described in AFM chapter 40.9.2(b)(3)(C):\n\n\n  [...]\n  \n  The requirement that the application was timely may be established\n  through the submission of evidence of the date the previously\n  authorized stay expired, together with a copy of a dated filing\n  receipt, a canceled check payable to USCIS for the EOS or COS\n  application, or other credible evidence of a timely filing.\n  \n  [...]\n  \n  To be considered non-frivolous, the application must have an arguable\n  basis in law and fact, and must not have been filed for an improper\n  purpose (such as to prolong one’s stay to pursue activities\n  inconsistent with one’s status).\n  \n  In determining whether an EOS or COS application was non-frivolous,\n  DOS has instructed consular posts that it is not necessary to make a\n  determination that USCIS would have ultimately ruled in favor of the\n  alien.\n\n\nAnd 9 FAM 302.11-3(B)(5)(b-c):\n\n\n  b. [...] Therefore, for all cases involving potential inadmissibility\n  under INA 212(a)(9)(B) whether under the three-year bar of\n  212(a)(9)(B)(i)(I) or the 10-year bar of INA 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(II), DHS\n  has decided to consider all time during which an application for\n  extension of stay (EOS) or change of nonimmigrant status (COS) is\n  pending to be a period of stay authorized by the Secretary of Homeland\n  Security provided:\n  \n  (1) The application was filed in a timely manner; i.e., before the\n  expiration date of the Form I-94, Arrival and Departure Record;\n  \n  (2) The application was \"nonfrivolous\"; and\n  \n  (3) The alien has not engaged in unauthorized employment (whether\n  before or after April 1, 1997).\n  \n  [...]\n  \n  c. To be considered \"nonfrivolous\" the consular officer must find that\n  the application had an arguable basis in law and fact and must not\n  have been filed for an improper purpose (e.g., as a groundless excuse\n  for the applicant to remain in activities incompatible with his or her\n  status).  It is not necessary to determine that the DHS would have\n  approved the application for it to be considered nonfrivolous.\n\n\nSo the question is whether her application of Extension of Status is \"frivolous\" or not. Note that it is possible for an application to be \"non-frivolous\" even if USCIS is likely to deny it; it just needs to have an \"arguable basis in law and fact\" and not be \"filed for an improper purpose\".\n\nIn my (non-professional) opinion, an application of Extension of Status for the reason of not being able to return to her home country to due COVID-19 flight bans is not frivolous. In the USCIS page on Special Situations, it mentions that for applications of Extension of Status and Change of Status, USCIS will take into consideration how special situations prevented your departure.\n",

    "title": "Getting refunded for a flight which I'll be prevented from boarding",
    "question": "In 2019 I booked a flight ticket with SAS to Svalbard. Unfortunately Covid19 happened.\n\nMy ticket is from a flight outside the nordic countries, with a layover in Oslo.\n\nI'll be prevented from entering Norway, since I'm not a resident. Moreover, even if I was already in Norway right now, I'd be prevented from boarding the flight from Oslo to Longyearbyen, since Svalbard  also separately restricted travel.\n\nTo add to the complexity, when I tried to book this ticket, SAS doesn't offer a flight with a single layover. All of the flights I found have a further layover in Stavanger, Stockholm, Copenhagen... even if SAS offers direct flights to Oslo! The solution I found was to book with a travel agent which sold me a ticket with a single layover.\n\nSo, SAS has a page for Covid19 information, with links to a search tool (a bit buggy and annoying to use) to check cancelled and confirmed flights, I haven't been able to confirm it for sure, but the closer we are to the departure date (it's less than 10 days from now), it seems that the less likely it'll be for it to be cancelled.\n\nI have the option of REBOOKING FREE OF CHARGE, unfortunately The rebooking can be made only once. and due to the current uncertainty, it's really difficult to pick another sensible date on which to plan my trip (no idea when Norway and Svalbard will reopen to visitors).\n\nIn theory, I have the option to exchange my flight ticket for a voucher, that way I'd have the option to defer choosing the new date, which would suit me much better. Unfortunately The voucher is valid for bookings made directly with SAS (not for bookings made by travel agents).\n\nI already contacted my travel agent 6 days ago. They ask not to call, and contact them via their ticketing system only for trips in the next 4 weeks. Unfortunately, both messages I sent them have been replied with an automated reply which suggests to call them on the phone (phone which only has a recorded message, saying that they are unable to take calls due to the huge volume of requests).\n\nSo, it seems that I'm stuck. I was thinking that given that in normal circumstances I have right to travel to norway (being an EEA citizen), if I'm denied boarding I should be able to at least hope for compensation according to EU regulation 261.  Though it seems there's an exception  For safety, security or health reasons, which usually is for different kinds of concerns, but it might be applied to a blanket ban on non-residents due to Covid19.\nRegardless if that exception happens, I'd have to actually attempt boarding (be at the airport on time) to actually claim compensation. I could do that, but that seems less than ideal:\n\n\nI'm social distancing, and I'd rather avoid a needless trip to the airport\nAs described above, I don't know if I should realistically expect compensation (maybe you can help me here)\nI'd have to hope that the airline would really not let me board (given that I'd then be stuck in Norway without a flight to come back immediately), though I guess I can go past the gate and then turn back before entering the plane.\n\n\nI guess that if the worst thing that happens to me during this pandemic is that I'll lose out on the money for this flight ticket, that's still pretty good, all things considered. Before giving up on it though, maybe you have some suggestion on how to able to be refunded?\n",

    "question": "I made a non-refundable hotel room booking through the hotel website. The hotel is located in the Netherlands.\n\nTwo days ago, a hotel manager informed me that they close the hotel for a certain period that included the period of my stay due to the Coronavirus, and that is why they were forced to move my reservation to another date. However, I do not want to move my reservation and would like to get the money back because I did not cancel my reservation, so I informed the hotel about it. The hotel, however, states that they are forced to move my reservation to another date as I made a non-refundable booking.\n\nI checked the official website of the government of the Netherlands as was advised here and the rules of the hotel on their website but have not found anything on this matter. The rules, however, are on Dutch, so I could misunderstand or skip something (I do not speak Dutch at all).\nAs far as I understand the situation based on John's question and answers, I am entitled to a refund. Are there some documents that I can cite to the hotel to get a refund?\n\nP.S. My sister booked the same hotel for the same dates (non-refundable hotel room booking as well) but through Booking. She was able to get a refund after several e-mails. However, she made the booking from Russia (the Netherlands deny the entry for foreigners having a tourist visa), while I did it from Germany where I have permanent residency.\n",

Just they try (maybe with a better offer) to keep booking (and money) for a later period.\n\nThe website booking.com doesn't get money from you (you will pay the hotel), so they have no really interest to have the \"move booking\" default.\n\nSo try to contact them, and think: do you want to book in a later date? In that case you may try to get a very good offer. But they must refund you.\n\nThe last step, it is to contact your credit card, and get the money back from them, because you were charged a service they will not offer you.\n",

    "answer": "Assuming you want to fly home (and you should only be trying to fly home), your best bet is the consular staff of your country. For example, various Canadian government agencies are tweeting about flights to Canada from specific airports. Here's a snapshot of the feed of travel.gc.ca:\n\n\n\nIn addition to following your country (and subsets of it like the \"Canada in Lebanon\" and \"Canada in Singapore\" accounts you see in the screenshot) you should have registered with your government so they can email, call or text you, and you should probably have called your embassy or consulate for advice about how to get home. \n\nIf you aren't trying to get home, but are trying to reach a relative or someone else who really needs you, these same sources are the ones that are likely to help you. If you think your travel need isn't urgent enough to get an embassy involved, then stop trying to travel. People are desperately trying to get home, to reunite families, to get out while they can. If you've just always wanted to see a particular place, now is not the time.\n\nBottom line: make sure at least one qualified human who is connected to your target country knows you're trying to get there, then start monitoring the heck out of airlines, airports, and those embassies and consulates on all the social media you can think of, and getting yourself on group chats and multi emails and facebook groups, so you'll be notified when there's a chance to go.

    "title": "Air Serbia reneged on an offer of compensation, citing Covid-19. Is this OK?",
    "question": "Someone I know booked a return flight on Air Serbia from Vienna to Podgorica (Montenegro) via Belgrade, departing on 6 March 2020 and returning on 14 March 2020.  On 10 March 2020, Air Serbia cancelled the return leg from Belgrade to Vienna without explanation; the passenger contacted Air Serbia by phone, who rebooked them on the next available flight, 24 hours later than the original return date.  Air Serbia told them on the phone that reasonable transport, meal, and accommodation costs for the unplanned overnight stay in Belgrade would be compensated.\n\nAccording to Air Serbia's statement of passenger rights*, the EU Regulation 261/2004 on flight compensation is integrated into Serbian law, so we assume that the passenger is entitled not only to the costs for the stay in Belgrade, but also €250 in compensation for the cancelled flight.\n\nThe passenger accordingly made a claim for compensation (both the overnight expenses and the €250 cancellation award) using Air Serbia's online form*, including all the relevant travel information and documentation (receipts, etc.).  Air Serbia just now rejected the claim as follows:\n\n\n  Thank you for your patience while the claim relating to your journey from BEG to PRG on 14.3.2020 was processed.\n  \n  After carefully reviewing your claim, I regret to inform you that we are not able to provide compensation in this case. This decision was reached taking into account the specific circumstances of your case, due to the coronavirus pandemic. Please note that the decision is final.\n  \n  We’re sorry that our service on 14.3.2020 did not meet your expectations and hope that we can look forward to welcoming you on-board an Air Serbia flight in the future.\n\n\nWe are skeptical about this rejection for the following reasons:\n\n\nOn the phone, Air Serbia had already promised compensation at least for the transport, accommodation, and meals in Belgrade.\nAir Serbia cancelled the flight before the governments of Serbia and Austria had imposed any restrictions on foreign travel relating to the coronavirus pandemic.\nAt no time before now had Air Serbia indicated that the cancellation was due to the pandemic.\nAccording to the answer to another Covid-19–related question here (May I get a refund for a flight cancelled because of COVID-19?), \"under EU rules you always get a refund\".\n\n\nWe would therefore like answers to the following:\n\n\nUnder Serbian or EU law (whichever is applicable in our case), is the passenger in fact entitled to compensation in this case?\nIf the answer to the previous question is \"yes\", then to what enforcement body can the passenger appeal Air Serbia's final decision?  The EU helpfully provides a list of national enforcement bodies for EC 261/2004, but Serbia is not on this list.  If there's no national enforcement body in Serbia, can the passenger appeal to the one in Austria, given that she bought the ticket and is resident there?\n\n\n\n\n* Note that due to Air Serbia's broken website, you may need to follow that link twice before the correct page appears.  It seems that first-time visitors to the website are always redirected to its home page.\n",

While it's not certain that this applies, it's highly likely now during Covid-19.\n\nHowever, extra expenses (accommodation, food) are to be reimbursed, per Article 9 of the EC261 regulation.\n\nSo contact them again and mention this (of course, attach the receipts). Tell them that Article 9 of EC261 applies regardless of any extraordinary circumstances.\n\nAnd if you want to be dead certain if extraordinary cirumstances apply or not (i.e. whether or not the €250 compensation is due), ask a firm such as Claimcompass to investigate it. It costs nothing, and they have sophisticated resources for checking things, but if they find compensation is due, they'll keep 35% of the amount for themselves.\n",

Of course, the chances of approval of an extension of status goes down with each additional extension. The fact that she has a US citizen spouse in the US also may make it likely that she will be denied for immigrant intent. But at least an application for extension of status (filed before her status expires) will allow her to stay while the application is pending, which can be several months, so it will buy her more time.\n\nAs some comments have noted, if she intends to keep staying in the US, it would be better for her to not apply for extension of status, and instead apply for Adjustment of Status to get a green card in the US through a petition from her spouse.\n",

    "answer": "The wording states \n\n\n...or similar body recommending evacuation from the country\n\n\n\nSo although the FCO might not have issued advice until later, the fact that the French government ordered all resorts closed should be sufficient.\n\nSo you need to find this advice from French government sources online, write back to your insurance company and be polite but firm and point this out to them.  Keep your letter short and to the point and state that you had no choice and the country was being locked down and all non-residents ordered to leave.\nTherefore, according to the T&amp;Cs of your policy you expect the claim to be honoured and paid in full ASAP.\n\nAlso point them to this statement from the Financial Conduct Authority:\nhttps://www.fca.org.uk/firms/insurance-and-coronavirus-our-expectations\n\nAnd this:\nhttps://www.choose.co.uk/news/2020/covid-19-insurance-policy-advice-government/\n\nState that you are disappointed with their behaviour and are considering complaining to the insurance ombudsman.

    "answer_id": "156647",
    "answer": "You can't just 'cancel because of coronavirus'. If the airline is still listing the flight then you can only cancel on whatever terms you agreed to when you booked.\n\nIf your ticket is fully refundable then you can cancel and rebook, if you can actually get the refund. Many airlines are refusing to pay refunds at present. \n\nMore likely, there will be some penalty for cancelling, which could be part or all of the fare you've paid. Even with the price reduction, it's likely that you'll end up paying more overall.\n\nIf you're hoping to get a full refund (as cash or voucher) then you'll have to wait until the airline cancels the flight, in which case there will be no flight to rebook onto.\n",

If you do not get a seat you have reserved you can claim a FULL refund. The cost of your ticket therefore DOES INCLUDE A RESERVED SEAT. it's just down to you to actually reserve it\n...\n\n2 - The National Conditions of Travel are the MINIMUM standard and what all train operators have to apply. Most train operators go well beyond that and I can't think of anyone who wouldn't refund the difference in cost for first class passengers travelling in a declassified coach.\n\n3 - yes it's a form you need to fill put but how else would you do it? it's like saying you want to return a dress and getting arsey because they want you to take it back to the shop.\n",

    "answer": "The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest). That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.\nHow long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e. time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials. The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.\nLearn more about CDC’s guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19. For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.\nSomeone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.",

The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. This type of spread is not a concern after death.\nIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\nPeople should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).\nCleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time). Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.

Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days.

    "answer": "\n\nStay in touch with your child’s school.\n\nMany schools are offering lessons online (virtual learning). Review assignments from the school, and help your child establish a reasonable pace for completing the work. You may need to assist your child with turning on devices, reading instructions, and typing answers.\nCommunicate challenges to your school. If you face technology or connectivity issues, or if your child is having a hard time completing assignments, let the school know.\n\n\nCreate a schedule and routine for learning at home, but remain flexible.\n\nHave consistent bedtimes, and get up at the same time, Monday through Friday.\nStructure the day for learning, free time, healthy meals and snacks, and physical activity.\nAllow flexibility in the schedule—it’s okay to adapt based on your day.\n\n\nConsider the needs and adjustment required for your child’s age group.\n\nThe transition to being at home will be different for preschoolers, K-5, middle school students, and high school students. Talk to your child about expectations and how they are adjusting to being at home versus at school.\nConsider ways your child can stay connected with their friends without spending time in person.\n\n\nLook for ways to make learning fun.\n\nHave hands-on activities, like puzzles, painting, drawing, and making things.\nIndependent play can also be used in place of structured learning. Encourage children to build a fort from sheets or practice counting by stacking blocks.\nPractice handwriting and grammar by writing letters to family members. This is a great way to connect and limit face-to-face contact.\nStart a journal with your child to document this time and discuss the shared experience.\nUse audiobooks or see if your local library is hosting virtual or live-streamed reading events.\n\n\n\n",

    "question": "Am I at risk if I touch someone who died of COVID-19 after they have passed away?",
    "answer": "COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19. The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. This type of spread is not a concern after death.\nIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\nPeople should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).\nCleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time). Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses.

    "wrong_answer": "In light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear a cloth face covering to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting. This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms. A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery stores, for example). Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance."

    "question": "Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals?",
    "answer": "At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets, can spread COVID-19 to people or that they might be a source of infection in the United States. To date, CDC has not received any reports of pets becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States.\nPets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.\nHowever, since animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene. For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDC’s Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.",

These actions are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory diseases like COVID-19.\n\nWhen washing hands, you can use plain soap or antibacterial soap. Plain soap is as effective as antibacterial soap at removing germs.\nIf soap and water are not readily available, you can use an FDA-approved alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. You can tell if the sanitizer contains at least 60% alcohol by looking at the product label.\n\nCDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product.

    "wrong_answer": "The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest). That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.\nHow long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e. time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials. The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.\nLearn more about CDC’s guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19. For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation see Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.\nSomeone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others."

Although there have not been reports of pets becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the new coronavirus. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
