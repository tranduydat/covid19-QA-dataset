    "question": "From this website , we can pull out $100,000 from our 401k without penalty.\n\n\n  Distributions taken from qualified retirement plans received during 2020\n  of up to $100,000 for COVID-19 related purposes are allowed without a\n  10% penalty, taxable evenly over 3 years beginning with year of\n  distribution\n\n\nWhat are the reasons not to cash out our 401k? In my opinion, my would greatly benefit to have this money in real estate or other investments. We have already saved up about a $150k for a house down payment, and having $100k more would allow us to buy a house in our area outright or with a very small mortgage. Alternatively, we could put it into the S&amp;P500 or Tbills, etc.\n\nEdit:\nBy \"other investments\" I mean something like a Roth IRA, which can be invested in similar stuff but with better long term tax implications. \n\nAlso, please note that prices of many investments will drop; so selling when its low is acceptable, assuming it is reinvested in something else that can also be purchased for cheap.\n",

    "answer": "There are a couple reasons:\n\n\nYou don't qualify. From your link:\n\n\n  Distributions taken from qualified retirement plans received during 2020 of up to $100,000 for COVID-19 related purposes are allowed without a 10% penalty, taxable evenly over 3 years beginning with year of distribution, and may be recontributed within 3 years. Related purposes include a COVID-19 diagnosis for you, your spouse or dependent, and financial hardship as a result of business closures, reduced work hours, lay off, furlough, lack of child care or other factors as determined by the Treasury Secretary.\n\n\nIf this doesn't apply to you, you can't do this anyway.\nTaxes. There is no penalty, but the withdrawal is still subject to taxes. You get to delay paying them, but they're at a higher rate than they would be if you withdrew at a slower rate and had no (or little) other income.\n\n\nAdditionally, you say \n\n\n  Alternatively, we could put it into the S&amp;P 500 or Treasury bills, etc. \n\n\nYou could do this inside your 401(k) without having to pay income taxes (at least until you actually withdraw).\n",
    "answer_type": "Reasonable",
    "wrong_answer": "There is no definitive answer. In general, with or without the penalty, it is advisable to keep your 401k balance, because the eventuality of retirement and old age still remain, and you will still need that money as a living income. It should still be your last resort, given how difficult it is even in normal times to build your nest egg, against present day financial demands and impulses. At least if you need to tap into your 401k, it's preferable to borrow from it than to withdraw, since 401k plans seem to give a generous enough window to \"repay yourself.\"\n",

I just checked, Amazon still charges $5.99 for Parasite, the exact same amount I paid when I rented it through them 6 weeks ago. \n\nWith theaters closing, the big studios still wanted a way to show their movies, so they brought them to the rental market sooner and they’re charging substantially more because the movie should still be in theaters and charged $19.99 to stay closer to movie ticket prices. (They may have some data that says something like 1.8 people on average watch a movie streamed through Amazon, and that’s why they charge more than the price of 1 ticket, but I don’t know for sure.)\n",

    "title": "When is coronavirus leading to FIP contagious?",
    "question": "I adopted two middle-aged (or older?) cats from the same shelter 3.5 years ago.  Both were healthy until recently when one developed FIP.  Since I adopted them they have had no contact with other cats, aside from whatever happens behind the scenes at the vet's office.\n\nAccording to this article from the Cornell Veterinary School, a cat can be exposed to the virus (with no symptoms) and develop FIP years later.  So it sounds like it's possible that my cat came to me already infected and the disease only manifested now.  (It's also possible that the other cat is a carrier who transmitted it to him without getting sick himself.)\n\nWhen is a cat with future-FIP infectious?  Only during an initial exposure to coronavirus (when my cat caught this), or from that time onward?  Only after developing FIP?  If a cat has been exposed to coronavirus in the past but has never shown symptoms of FIP, can he transmit that coronavirus to other cats?\n\nI am trying to figure out the effect of this on my remaining cat, and whether I can safely adopt another cat to join him.  There is no reliable test for FIP other than biopsies, so at best testing can tell us if he's been exposed to coronavirus (the test looks for the antibodies). But my biggest concern is whether he could be infectious.  (If he's also infected then, sadly, there's nothing we can do about that.  We can only test for coronavirus and coronavirus doesn't always lead to FIP from what I've read.)\n",

And yes as you mentioned, not all coronavirus cats will develop FIP.\n\nFrom my \"Common Diseases of Companion Animals\" textbook:\n\n\n  80% to 90% of cats in catteries have antibodies to FECV and these cats shed virus intermittently.\n\n\nThat being said by continuously disinfecting and only having one/two cat(s) in your home you can eventually clear out FECV (most common household disinfectants work).\n\nYou can check your current cat what his current anti-body levels are for coronavirus if you're concerned about a new cat coming in as well.\n\nAn excerpt from veterinary partner on FECV:\n\n\n  An active infection lasts several weeks to a few months. Virus is shed in the infected cat’s stool during this period. If the cat is reinfected, virus sheds again for weeks to months. During this time, the cat may or may not seems at all ill. Some infected cats do not shed virus.\n  \n  The mutation to a form of virus that can cause FIP is more likely to occur in an immune-compromised cat. Most cats with FIP are less than one year old (their immaturity is their immune compromise). Crowding is also an important source of immune-compromise. Another important factor in mutation is multiple exposure/infections. When cats keep getting reinfected, the virus they carry has more chance of mutating to a form that causes FIP.\n\n\nI've only seen 3 cases of FIP in almost 4 years in practice, it's not very common.\n",

(It was \"the year of the W\" and she had been very big for a female kitten.  I had shown up to buy her sister, Whistlepop, but had left with Whopper - my very own fluffy little malted milk ball. =)  When Whopper was about three years old, she developed Lymphocytic-Plasmacytic Gingivitis Stomatitis (LPGS).  My poor, sweet girl had such problems with her mouth.  It was horrible.  I didn't find online at the time that Birmans were susceptible to this, but Persians were, and I’d found a couple different websites where the authors stated that some people believed the Birman breed had a strong influx of Persian in their development.  There is no cure for LPGS.  During my research, I also found that Birmans had an increased susceptibility to develop FIP.  Whopper never got FIP though.  She died in 2006 right before her 7th birthday of kidney disease.  I didn’t realize there was a problem until it showed up in her pre-surgical bloodwork when she went in to get her teeth cleaned.  By then, she was pretty far along in the progression of the disease.  I was heartbroken.  It’s unusual for a 6-year-old cat to get kidney disease.  When I researched the disease in the Birman breed after she was diagnosed, I found that Persians had a high risk of developing kidney disease, and Birmans had a moderate risk.  I cried for over a year after she died.  It was four years before I could think about her without tears coming to my eyes.  We had been very tightly bonded.  I close with some advice for you:  No matter WHAT breed you choose, there WILL be health problems associated with that breed.  Spend lots of time researching the breed and also choosing from the most reputable breeders you can find who test their cats for problems before breeding and breed ONLY for the betterment of the breed.  Be willing to spend more for your kitten.  Testing costs money.  Do your very best to get the best odds for yourself in obtaining the healthiest kitten possible.  I’m sure this is an old question and the person who originally asked it has long since found a kitten for themselves, but I would like to help others who read this in the future.

    "title": "Cat Vomiting Every Day",
    "question": "My cat (approximately 16 years old, short hair, no specific breed, indoor cat) has been vomiting pretty much every day (sometimes multiple times) for almost a month.\n\nShe had a scare with her kidneys about 2 years ago (elevated results of urea and creatine) and has had blood tests regularly since but her levels fell and have been good ever since.\n\nHer brother passed away a few years ago from stomach cancer, and he showed similar symptoms in the beginning but when we've taken her to the vets they've done X-Ray and ultrasound and other than a slight thickening of the stomach lining couldn't see any lumps or anything out of the ordinary. She has also had blood tests and everything looks fine, very good kidney results, no sign of liver issues, no sign of diabetes.\n\nShe's been on antacids and laxatives from the vet (as much as we can get in her, she's not good with meds and gets very distressed) but they don't seem to be having any effect.\nWhen she's been in to the vets they sometimes give her an anti-nausea injection which stops her being ill for a few days and then it starts up again.\nShe's also had antibiotics, dewormer, B12 and a steroid injection at various times. Any improvement is only temporary for a few days and then she starts vomiting again.\n\nShe's a fussy eater and she gets dry food (Purina One, various flavours), tuna and white fish. Also occasionally ham. She won't eat much else. She gets sick mostly in the morning and we suspected Bilious Vomiting Syndrome, but she already has food down through the day and gets other regular food throughout the day too, including late at night and that hasn't improved anything.\n\nMost days she might be sick once (and it tends to be thick and dark brown, occasionally with food in or clumps of hair but mostly liquid) but sometimes it's two or three times.\nShe's otherwise eating fine, drinking and urinating a normal amount and pooing regularly (not sure the laxative is making any difference).\n\nThe vets seem to be a bit stumped and just keep telling us to give her the laxatives / antacid but there's obviously something else going on.\n\nThe only major change recently is that we were giving her a glycosamine and mineral supplement for arthritis which we were mixing with milk to get her to take it as it was the only way to guarantee she'd take it all. We ran out of the first course a couple of weeks before she started getting sick and didn't get any more before she got ill, so it's been about six weeks since she had the supplement or any milk.\n\nWe're really worried but don't know what else to do. Everything is also complicated by the fact we're in the UK and the country is on lockdown because of Coronavirus so while the vet is still open it's not easy to get an appointment.\n\nWe're waiting on a stronger antacid from the vets and we're going to try to give her exclusively white fish for a few days to see if diet is contributing (but it's the same diet she's been on for years).\n\nAny ideas what it could be or what we could try next?\nThe fact she seems to be in good health (particularly for her age) is what's confusing us as all the things we've seen that fit have a list of other symptoms that she just hasn't got.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "The Sharingan and Mangekyou Sharingan are caused by a special kind of ocular chakra originating in an Uchiha's brain. Usually, a cause of powerful emotion will awaken the Sharingan, and great loss will evolve it into the Mangekyou. Once unlocked, activating them is fairly easy. They can be transplanted, and even retain their abilities. Though it may have been an exception due to its spacetime powers, Kakashi's case showed it could even evolve to the Mangekyou despite not being in an Uchiha. Kakashi could activate and deactivate the Mangekyou form. However, he could never deactivate the Sharingan, and hence had to cover up his Sharingan eye when not in use to preserve chakra.\n\nNext, after Obitos's death, he used his space time powers to transfer his chakra to Kakashi. By doing so, he also transfered his ocular chakra, which temporarily awakened Obito's Mangekyou in Kakashi. Once that Chakra was used up and the Sharingan released, it was gone for good.\n\nLastly, there is one who went through a very similar situation, Madara. As pointed out, Madara at one time had Obito's Mangekyou and his own Rinnegan. By having a 2nd eye, despite having unlocked the Rinnegan, did not evolve it into a Rinnegan. He even transplanted regular Sharingan before his death, but they did not evolve into Rinnegan either, despite up to several years between him giving his Rinnegan to Nagato, transplanting the spare Sharingan and dying.\n\nNow, of course those were not Madara's real eyes, but the fact that he had the ocular chakra required to awaken even the Rinnegan, but couldn't do so with a Sharingan and a Mangekyou eye says a lot.\n\nWith all that established, We have a decent amount of evidence backing up what would happen if Naruto grew a new eye for Obito. Most likely, what would happen is the new eye would be a normal Uchiha eye, which is almost identical to any other regular eye. It would have the potential to unlock the Sharingan and Mangekyou Sharingan, and Obito could probably more easily unlock them than normal, but its impossible to say if it would happen immediately, take months to do so, or anywhere in between.\n\nSo, transplanting Obito's left eye into Kakashi, and then having Naruto regrow Obitos eye would likely be able to create 2 eyes with Obito's Mangekyou powers, given an unknown amount of time before he could reawaken his powers.\n\nThat however shows the main reason why they didn't do so, besides the situation preventing them from thinking about it. They couldn't risk it not working instantly. Obito was under Zetsus control until Kaguya showed up, and they needed everything they had to just barely pull off that victory. Obito having his left eye's powers is what both got Sasuke out of the dimension Kaguya threw him into alone, and saved Kakashi from her All-Killing Ash Bones. The odds that his new left eye being fully awakened to Mangekyou within the few minutes before it was needed are slim to none. Then after it was used twice in critical circumstances, he turned to ash.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "I don't recall an exact year, but there's evidence that the series takes place in the modern day, between 2007 and 2018.\n\nThe strongest piece of evidence comes from the novels. In Kabukimonogatari Chapter 7, after Koyomi travels back in time 11 years, he notes that the money is different and has Natsume Souseki on it. These would have been the series D bills issued from 1984 to 2007 and suspended April 2007. This puts the series no more than 11 years after 2007, or no later than 2018. The novel version of Otorimonogatari has Nadeko make a reference to K-On, also putting it after May 2007, when the K-On manga started.\n\nMaroon notes in the comments that the dates line up better for 2006. The phasing out of the Souseki notes began in 2004, so 2006 is a plausible year as well. The novels began their run in August 2005, so it's possible that Nisio Isin looked to March 2006 as the starting point for the series.\n\nSmartphones do exist in the world of Monogatari; in the preview on Episode 7 of Nisemonogatari, Kaiki complains that after Hitagi smashed his phone, he went to buy a new one and could only find smartphones, which he dislikes. Here's a hard-to-see picture of my television screen that shows it:\n\n\n\nFlip phones are actually still pretty common in Japan; see this Answerman column. \n\nAs a side note, the male protagonist hiding porn books in his room is a time-honored tradition of the genres that Monogatari draws on, harem and school action. Suruga also fills her room up with cheap BL books instead of going on the Internet and reading slash fiction. Monogatari is a mixture of real and hyper-real, so sometimes it just plays by the rules of fiction.\n",

Even if you don't know Japanese, it's fairly easy to purchase stuff from Amazon Japan - when you go to the website, you should see a link that says \"in English\". \n\n\n\nClick on it, and most (though I don't think all) of the interface gets changed over to English. Product descriptions and stuff don't, though.\n\nOnce you've done that, you'll need to make an account, even if you have an account on Amazon US or Amazon UK or whatever. The process is the same as making an account on any other Amazon site.\n\nThe product you want to purchase is either this one for BD, or this one for DVD. In either case, you can pre-order it. If you do place a pre-order, the product should leave Amazon's Japanese warehouse on release day and get to you probably less than a week later.\n\nAs far as I know, there is only one option available for global shipping from Amazon Japan. You will be charged probably $10-12 for shipment to the US. I don't know about other countries. If you are in the US, you should choose to pay in USD, so as to avoid foreign transaction fees on your credit card.\n\nIncidentally, you can also preorder the second movie (BD, DVD) for when it releases on 2 Apr 2016.\n\n\n\nMuch of the advice above is generally applicable to purchasing any BDs and DVDs from Amazon Japan. Amazon Japan isn't always the cheapest option, but it is definitely the most convenient, at least for US-based buyers. However, if you are planning on purchasing a large number of items in a short period of time, you may be able to save on shipping by using a proxy service like Tenso.

    "question": "The COVID-19 outbreak has been dominating the news recently, with loads of headlines and efforts being made to stop it from spreading.\n\nWhy this disease? It's not one of the most lethal ones, or one of the deadliest. Compare:\n\n\nCOVID-19 - infected 24,478; deaths 492\nMalaria - infected 228 million; deaths 405,000 (2018 data)\nTuberculosis - infected 25% of world population, i.e. ~2 billion; deaths 1.6 million (2017 data)\nHIV/AIDS - infected 37.9 million; 1.7 million new cases a year; deaths 770,000 (2018 data)\n\n\nCompared to malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, the COVID-19 outbreak is pretty much a rounding error.\n\nIn terms of lethality, COVID-19 has a case fatality rate of 1.4-6.5%. This is still well below the lethality of tuberculosis (43%) and HIV/AIDS (80-90% after 5 years if untreated), although it is more lethal than malaria (~0.3%)\n\nIt seems like, objectively, COVID-19 is a very small fish in the pond of infectious diseases. It's not like the three diseases above are unique either; there're lots more diseases that affect &amp; kill more people than nCoV (e.g. measles, leishmaniosis). Yet, right now, when people die of COVID-19 they make the news, while thousands of people die of the other three diseases every day without getting a mention.

    "answer": "The short answer to this question is that 2019-nCoV is new. All the other diseases you mentioned are known quantities: epidemiologists have a good idea how they behave, how they spread, what is likely to happen in a variety of different scenarios, etc. But this disease represents a new mutation that behaves differently from other coronaviruses. It's far more transmissible than other coronaviruses, and worse, seems to be transmissible through casual contact: not intimate contact, blood or fluid exposure, not through an intermediary vector like a tick or flea. Currently the death toll is low, but researchers simply do not have enough data to know whether that trend will continue. \n\nRemember, the death rate of influenza is lower than that of this coronavirus. The 1958 and 1967 influenza pandemics had death rates of about 0.1%, and the 1918 pandemic had a death rate of about 2.5%*. But those pandemics killed millions because they were so transmissible they infected hundreds of millions. If the coronavirus follows that pattern and turns pandemic, we might expect to see any city of a million or so people suffer 20,000 to 30,000 deaths over the course of a couple of months (say 400-500 per day), which is a huge number of people dying by any calculus.

    "wrong_answer": "It's been called the \"cycle of oppression\":\n\n\n  The oppressed group behavior model suggests that persons who are in groups that are subordinate to more powerful groups in their society learn certain behavior patterns that, although necessary for their survival, lead to a cycle of further oppression\n\n\nI don't know if the term has gained much traction (with this meaning). But it is based on the philosophy of Paulo Freire, who argues it in a bit more detail, as summarized in IEP:\n\n\n  Freire warns the oppressed against becoming oppressors on two counts: (1) whether the oppressed gain power and use this power to oppress their previous oppressor; or (2) in the case of the oppressed gaining power over other oppressed people and becoming their oppressors, as they seek their own individual liberation. The danger of a previously oppressed person becoming an oppressor is due to their ambiguous duality. Freire points out that the oppressed are at one and the same time both themselves (the oppressed) and the oppressor, whose consciousness they have internalized. Due to this ambiguous duality and the internalization of their oppressors, the oppressed seek to become like the oppressors and share in their way of life.\n\n\nA more general concept is that history repeats itself, perhaps in \"disguised\" ways.\n\nSome ancient Greeks posited a more elaborate version... the Kyklos:\n\n\n  According to Polybius, who has the most fully developed version of the cycle, it rotates through the three basic forms of government, democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy and the three degenerate forms of each of these governments ochlocracy, oligarchy, and tyranny. Originally society is in ochlocracy but the strongest figure emerges and sets up a monarchy. The monarch's descendants, who because of their family's power lack virtue, become despots and the monarchy degenerates into a tyranny. Because of the excesses of the ruler the tyranny is overthrown by the leading citizens of the state who set up an aristocracy. They too quickly forget about virtue and the state becomes an oligarchy. These oligarchs are overthrown by the people who set up a democracy. Democracy soon becomes corrupt and degenerates into ochlocracy, beginning the cycle anew.\n\n",

In an announcement that introduced a new team to tackle the virus, Trump said that\n\n\n  Because of all we've done (so far), the risk to the American people remains very low.\n\n\nand that\n\n\n  It is what it is.

    "answer": "Rather poorly one could say, with respect to testing. There's now outrage that the CDC has pursued its own flawed test kit under some version of NIH (which in this case stands for \"not invented here\"), rather than adopt the one used by the WHO (and which was developed in Germany)...\n\n\n  On Monday, following mounting criticism of the federal response, Trump administration officials promised a rapid expansion of the country’s testing capacities. With the help of private companies and academic centers, as many as a million diagnostic tests could be administered by the end of this week, said Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.\n  \n  But many scientists wonder if the moves come too late. [...] Most disturbing of all: Did a failure to provide adequate testing give the coronavirus time to gain a toehold in the United States?\n  \n  “Clearly, there have been problems with rolling out the test,” said Dr. Thomas Frieden, former director of the C.D.C. “There are a lot of frustrated doctors and patients and health departments.”\n  \n  Still, Dr. Frieden said he thought the situation was improving. Other experts, although supportive of the agency, were mystified that federal officials could have committed so many missteps.\n  \n  “The incompetence has really exceeded what anyone would expect with the C.D.C.,” said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at Harvard University. “This is not a difficult problem to solve in the world of viruses.”\n  \n  Officials at the C.D.C. did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The agency abruptly canceled a news conference on Monday just as it was to begin. Officials appeared to have removed figures on the agency website counting how many Americans had been tested.\n  \n  In February, the C.D.C. rolled out a three-step diagnostic test and distributed testing kits — each of which could run about 800 tests — to state and local health laboratories. But some of the components of the diagnostic kits were flawed, and produced inconclusive results.\n  \n  A three-step replacement was promised but never arrived; the agency has not fully explained why, except to say that there was a manufacturing defect. As a result, diagnostic testing was only conducted at the agency’s labs in Atlanta.\n  \n  The C.D.C. eventually rolled out a two-step replacement and permitted a few laboratories, where the kits had been working, to continue using their tests. But those with only one working component of the test still could not diagnose patients on their own.\n  \n  Getting results from the C.D.C. took days, however, and in any event the criteria for testing were strict — among them, the patient must have had recent travel to China or contact with someone known to be infected.\n  \n  Doctors nationwide complained of a bottleneck, both because of the restrictive test criteria and because of the agency’s limited testing capacity. The agency said it had the capacity to test about 400 specimens a day.\n  \n  The test criteria were “too stringent, and people aren’t getting tested,” said Lauren M. Sauer, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n  \n  [...]\n  \n  “We have been really frustrated, because one of the things that is a hallmark of public health labs is that we are usually ‘ready, set, go,’ and here we were — ‘ready, set, wait’,” said Scott Becker, chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories.\n  \n  Late last week, the Food and Drug Administration broke the logjam, authorizing state and local laboratories to do initial testing on their own. If labs had developed and validated a test, they could use it for diagnosis instead of relying on the C.D.C.’s version or waiting for a replacement.\n  \n  Other nations have tested patients by tens of thousands. China has probably tested millions.\n  \n  “How come the South Koreans can do 10,000 tests a day and we can’t?” said Ralph Baric, who studies coronaviruses and emerging diseases at University of North Carolina.\n  \n  Soon after the virus surfaced in China, the C.D.C. got to work on its own test. “Generally, C.D.C. provides these tests for the world,” said Dr. Frieden.\n  \n  But German researchers were devising their own test, which was quickly adopted by the World Health Organization for distribution around the world.\n  \n  After the C.D.C.’s version turned out to be flawed, the agency continued to pursue it, despite the fact that another diagnostic test was already in wide use.\n  \n  With F.D.A. approval, the agency could simply have distributed the test used by the W.H.O. instead of creating a new one from scratch, Dr. Mina said. The government could do so even now.\n  \n  “It’s just a very American approach to say, ‘We’re the U.S., the major U.S. public health lab, and we’re going to not follow the leader,’” Dr. Mina said.\n\n",

It wasn't even a claim that it was happening, more like a quip that it might happen.\n\nThe US healthcare vs Euro/Canadian-style coverage debate has been done to death, but it usually revolves around the problems lack of coverage brings to the people who are ill.  This is not what I am asking about.\n\nAn epidemic situation however brings a different dynamic:  there's a vested interested for everyone else that sick people are identified as such and isolated, it's not just about the being well-being of the patients.  To assist in containment, you want to remove as many barriers to early diagnosis as possible.\n\nIs there/could there be some form of emergency funding for at least the tests themselves, at the federal level?  One model is for example, the financial arrangements around vaccination programs.\n\nEdit:\n\nthe question concerns the procedure for the entire test, i.e. lab services as well as clinic time:  seeing a doctor/nurse, taking the tests and getting the results.  Nothing more, but also all of what's necessary for a YES/NO answer wrt having COVID-19 or not.  \n\nBryan's answer is great wrt to the kit and lab services themselves, but someone still needs to interview you and take whatever samples are necessary to send off for testing,\n\nDo these arrangements vary by state?

    "answer": "While it has clearly been shown by the virility of the virus so far that travel restrictions will not stop the inevitable community spread of the illness, and that their effectiveness as impeding the spread of the virus is small, the aim of the policy is no longer to stop the virus, but to delay it. This was confirmed as current policy in the UK's response to the virus by the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, on March 5th.\n\nThere are a few reasons why this is the goal of many governments. Firstly, if the peak of the pandemic can be delayed, this allows plans to be put in place for management of the crisis. For example, in the UK, plans have been floated that would allow final year medical students and trainee doctors to take on hospital duties during the nine week period that the virus is currently predicted to have the highest effect on the NHS, in order to mitigate the strain on the service.\n\nSecondly, delaying the spread of the virus allows time for a vaccine to be developed. While research on this is progressing quickly, it will still take time for the vaccine to pass clinical trials and be approved for human usage. In addition, as @Patricia Shanahan points out in the comments, the effectiveness of existing drugs already approved for treating similar respiratory diseases can be evaluated, which could be ready sooner than developing brand new drugs or a vaccine.\n\nFinally, as health services are acknowledged as being under the most strain during the winter months, the best time for the pandemic to peak would be in the middle of summer.\n\nTo this end, the policy of travel bans, while having been shown to be relatively ineffective at preventing the spread of the disease outright, is being used to delay the spread of the virus as much as possible, to allow national governments to prepare for the full impact of the peak of the predicted pandemic.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "Background\n\n\n  Britain's railways were nationalised by Labour in 1948 and returned to private hands by John Major's Conservative government in 1993.\n  Labour was initially committed to renationalisation but the policy was dropped when Tony Blair came to power in 1997. Track, signalling and stations were taken out of private hands, and put into a not-for-profit company, Network Rail, after the collapse of Railtrack in 2002.\n\n\nWhy Re-Nationalise?\n\n\n  The cost of the railway to the taxpayer has subsequently more than doubled in real terms, a rise out of all proportion to the 33% increase in train services over the same period. \n  \n  The cost rises stem from wastage as shareholder dividend pay-outs, other inefficient private sector financing and inefficiencies created by fragmentation of the railway.\n  \n  The wastage amounts to over £1bn per year, enough to cut fares by 20% if the railway were reunified as a public company.\n  \n  ...run by companies that are wholly or partly publicly owned, but by other countries. Deutsche Bahn is foremost - they even run the Royal Train - and the German Government have said \"We're skimming profit from the entire Deutsche Bahn...it is invested in the rail network here in Germany\". \n  \n  So, if you are reading this on an overcrowded train with a ticket that made a painful hole in your wallet, take heart from your generous contribution to improvement of Germany's fine publicly-owned railway. \n\n\nIn short, re-nationalise to remove the inefficiencies in the fragmented railway system, provide more accountability, prevent \"off-shoring\" of profits from operating the railway network by foreign, state-owned, firms. Finally - make fares cheaper by reducing cost.\n\nWhy Keep Privatised?\n\n\n  The UK's railway network was built privately and competitively and by some way its most successful years were the private eras between 1830 and 1922 and 1994 to the present. \n  \n  Returning it to centralised state control would be a step backwards and a mistake. \n  \n  Instead we should end the practice of franchising, which creates private monopolies, and allow real competition and diversity.\n  \n  The solution to our current problems is not more state bungling, it is a return to diversity, competition and open markets.\n\n\nIn short, keep privatised to avoid a step backward, because the railway was privatised during it's most successful years. End franchising which creates per-route monopolies.\n\nSource: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22700805\n\nThe Politics\n\n\n  British people support re-nationalising the railways by 60-20% - for the main reason that they should be accountable to taxpayers rather than shareholders\n\n\nSource: https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/05/11/why-do-people-support-rail-nationalisation/\n",

    "title": "Did Bernie Sanders receive low youth voter turnout during the Super Tuesday primaries?",
    "question": "So a series of news articles are being spread around that purportedly attributes some of Bernie Sanders' losses in states due to low voter turnout.   A quick search on Google reports tens of articles all claiming the same or similar findings:\n\n\nGoogle search\n\n\nHowever, I recently saw an article on Reddit that says this claim is being falsified by purposely misattributing one statistic as another, but I don't know how verifiable the information is considering it's not a news source I'm familiar with.\n\n\nBernie Sanders and the Myth of Low Youth Turnout in the Democratic Primary\n\n\nIf anything, I am more wary of the quantity of news reports. Earlier this month, Snopes.com published a fact-checking article disproving a wide swathe of news reports that Corona beer sales dropped due to fear about the coronavirus, and this is something I am not sure is also going on with the Sanders/youth voter turnout issue.\n\nIn any case, did low youth turnout affect Bernie Sanders' results in the Super Tuesday primaries?  Or, as the 2nd linked article claims, is it not true?\n",
    "answer_id": "50821",
    "answer": "There's a lot of spin going on in all camps, including the Sanders camp. This is par for the course in a political election year.\n\nThe article you cited is guilty of the same criticisms it makes of other articles. It fails to provide any concise information about how many voters in the 18-29 age range in 2020 turned out compared to 2016.\n\nIn fairness, this is partly because election officials do not track voters by age when they vote. So the only way to know anything about this kind of metric is to look at the same exit polls the article rejects as inaccurate.\n\nThe Sanders campaign, like other campaigns, do their own polling and sampling. So they have pretty much the best idea of anyone as to how well they've really done. So listen to what Bernie himself said:\n\n\"Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing in young people in? And the answer is 'no',\" he told reporters at a press briefing on Wednesday.\n\n\"We're making some progress but historically everybody knows that young people do not vote in the kind of numbers that older people vote,\" Sanders went on. \"I think that will change in the general election. But to be honest with you, we have not done as well in bringing young people into the process. It is not easy.\"\n\nSource: https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-admits-hes-not-inspiring-enough-young-voters-2020-3\n\nHowever, that's not the only thing we can infer from available data. If you put together a spreadsheet state-by-state to tally vote totals compared to votes received by Sanders, you will see a strong pattern. The data shows that Sanders' overall vote count is running 20-30% LOWER than in 2016 in most states that have voted so far, despite the fact that across-the-board vote count is running 10-30% HIGHER than in 2016. Sanders defenders argue that this is because the field was so much bigger and stronger than in 2016, but I see this as a throwaway argument. If Sanders was really a strong vote-getter, he wouldn't be bleeding support compared to 2016 because the ones who voted for him then already knew him, whereas his opponents this year were mostly newcomers to the primaries. He already had name recognition that the others didn't have among Democratic voters.\n\nSo what does this broader insight tell us? Well, all of the polls we've seen say that Sanders' support levels are strongest among the 18-29 age range. So if he's hemorrhaging that much voter support in the overall numbers, it either means that the number of voters in the 18-29 range matched 2016 while the rest of his supporters disappeared almost completely into the woodwork, or (much more likely) his support among 18-29 year olds sagged compared to four years ago along with the other age groups.\n\nGiven Sanders' remarks Business Insider quoted, I'd go with the latter likelihood.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "TL;DR\n\n\nThe key founders of Russian Communism have openly declared that the Marxism and religion are „incompatible“. Namely, Marxism has declared the lines of conduct which are opposite to Orthodox Christianity, the most popular religion of the Russia;\nMarxism, at least, as it has been understood by Russian Bolsheviks, was a dogmatic, non-scientific belief, hence, a direct competitor to many world's religions of the time.\nThe Russian Orthodox Church has been adopted by KGB during the times of WWII, when it became apparent that Marxist ideology is not sufficient for controlling the masses.\n\n\n\n\nYielding the Floor to an Ideologist\n\nFirst, a note on terminology.\nBelow, the quotes mistakenly (or deliberately) mix two terms: Marxism (an ideology) and Communism/Socialism (a ruling regime, or a type of a government). The question also contains this mistake. Communism (a regime) can't oppose religion in general, but Marxism (an ideology) can.\n\nNikolai Bukharin, one of the key ideologists of Russian Communism and prolific author on „revolutionary theory“, wrote in his book, The ABC of Communism (1919):\n\n\n  Chapter 11: Communism and Religion\n  § 89. Why religion and communism are incompatible\n  \n  Many weak-kneed communists reason as follows: 'Religion does not prevent my being a communist. I believe both in God and in communism. My faith in God does not hinder me from fighting for the cause of the proletarian revolution.'\n  \n  This train of thought is radically false. Religion and communism are incompatible, both theoretically and practically.\n  \n  In practice, no less than in theory, communism is incompatible with religious faith. The tactic of the Communist Party prescribes for the members of the party definite lines of conduct. The moral code of every religion in like manner prescribes for the faithful some definite line of conduct.\n  \n  — marxists.org\n\n\n\n\nCompetition\n\nAs I mention in another answer, Marxism is an ideology of class supremacy. Proletariat supposed to be the \"master class\", while others are \"lower\" ones.\n\nHowever, the majority of proletarians were not familiar with Marxist ideology. There was also no goal to teach them with the details of Marxism. As a result, the vast majority of them simply believed that Marxism is right without knowing Marxist ideas in any depth, just the same way as in Tsarist Russia they believed in Christianity while sincerely thinking that Jesus Christ was a Russian, not to mention the deeper aspects of Christianity.\n\nSo, there was no place for two competing ideologies, equivalent to each other in most aspects, as it was understood by the overwhelming majority of the population.\n\n\n\nAdoption by KGB\n\nHowever, in 1940s the Stalin's regime has decided that suppressing the religion is not effective:\n\n\n  After Nazi Germany's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Joseph Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church to intensify patriotic support for the war effort. — Wikipedia\n\n\nBy the last years of the „Soviet Union“,\n\n\n  \"Not a single candidate for the office of bishop or any other high-ranking office, much less a member of Holy Synod, went through without confirmation by the Central Committee of the CPSU and the KGB\" — Wikipedia\n\n\nNowadays, the KGB officer codename „Mikhailov“ is allegedly the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n",

    "title": "Why has Russia declined OPEC's request to cut oil production?",
    "question": "On Friday, Russia declined to participate in a plan devised by the Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut oil production levels, in order to keep oil prices steady in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The article describes this refusal as the cause of the 10% oil price crash on Friday alone, which was exacerbated by a further 30% crash on Monday.\n\nWhat reasons has Russia given for their refusal to participate in the OPEC group's plan?\n",
    "answer_id": "50852",
    "answer": "Disclaimer: I'm no expert, this answer is based on my modest understanding of the situation at play.\n\nThe OPEC decision to cut oil production was meant to keep prices high: if every OPEC country were selling all the oil they could, it would drive prices down since there would be more supply than demand. So if every OPEC country agrees to sell only a limited amount of oil, the global supply matches the global demand and prices stay high. Naturally this works only if all the big oil producing countries play the game: it's tempting for a country to sell more than its agreed quota, especially if the price is high.\n\nRussia is not an official member of OPEC, only an observer. As such, it is free to follow OPEC policies or not, depending on its own interests and strategy. I'm not aware of any official reason why Russia refused to follow this particular recent decision, but it looks like a rational economic decision: if many oil producers (competitors) reduce their supply and the prices are high, why would Russia limit their own supply if they have no obligation to?  \n\n\"This refusal is cited as the cause of the 10% oil price crash on Friday alone, which was exacerbated by a further 30% crash on Monday.\"\n\nThis is not the full explanation: the Russian refusal led Saudi Arabia to cancel the original plan to reduce production (Guardian), and instead to flood the market with their own oil. This is what drove prices down sharply, especially in the current context of low demand due to the corona virus.\n\nThe Saudi surprise strategy could arguably be interpreted as a kind of tactical response against Russia's refusal to play according to OPEC rules: since Russia apparently wants to reap the benefits of high prices without sacrificing their own production, Saudi Arabia is telling them that \"two can play this game\". The effect is that all the oil producing countries are going to suffer from low prices, but some more than others:\n\n\n  The new strategy adopted by Riyadh appears to target Russia and US shale oil firms, many of which are known to have high production costs and lose money when crude prices fall below $50 a barrel for more than a few months.\n\n\nSaudi Arabia can produce oil at a lower cost than Russia and US shale oil industry, so they are probably trying to use the opportunity of the Russian refusal to get rid of some competitors: Saudi Arabia can afford to take a temporary economic hit, whereas many shale oil companies may go bankrupt quickly. Strategically, their initiative is certainly also meant to assert their dominance on the oil market.\n\n\n\n[Added: a similar analysis by Kevin Drum, found just after posting my answer]\n\n\n  The nickel version of this story is that oil prices started declining in February due to fears of lower demand caused by the coronavirus outbreak. OPEC tried to cut a deal with Russia to reduce output all around, but Russia balked. Saudi Arabia then decided to bring out its big guns, lowering prices immediately by about $7 per barrel and announcing that it would increase output in order to take share away from Russia. At that point the decline turned into a rout, with the price of WTI crude collapsing to $28 as I write this.\n\n",

    "question": "On March 3rd, the UK government released a publication detailing its Coronavirus action plan, which contains the four-stage plan that will be implemented throughout the country, in all four devolved nations, as the impact of the disease continues to worsen. Below is a brief summary of each stage:\n\n\nContain - identify cases as soon as possible, and attempt to prevent wider community spread of the virus. Powers have been given to enforce quarantines and extra funding granted to healthcare centres. The goal is to stop the virus from taking hold in the country.\nDelay - if containment does not work, measures such as closing schools, banning large gatherings, and incentivising working from home will be introduced. The goal is to delay the inevitable spread of the virus for as long as possible.\nResearch - if measures taken to delay the virus prove ineffective, focus efforts on researching how to best fight the virus; working out how it spreads, and the best treatment methods. This includes research into vaccine development and deployment.\nMitigate - the last resort scenario, at this point the government will focus on keeping essential services such as police/fire/ambulance functional, as well as bringing retired and newly graduated doctors to the frontlines.\n\n\nAt the moment, the UK Government insists that the country is still in the containment phase, despite the country's Chief Medical Officer and the government's chief medical advisor, Prof. Chris Whitty telling MPs as early as March 5th that the UK \"was now \"mainly\" in the delay phase\".\n\nAt first glance the government's refusal to move to the delay phase, despite 460 total cases, and confirmed community spread, seems stubborn and almost deluded, however, the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport, Jeane Freeman told MSPs after attending a COBRA meeting on the 10th that \n\n\n  The timing of moving into the ‘delay’ phase, and what measures are\n  judged to be the most effective in that phase, must be and are driven\n  very firmly by scientific and clinical advice. Understandably people\n  will be looking to the situation in other countries and questioning\n  why some of the moves they are taking are not being made here yet in\n  Scotland and in the UK.\n  \n  [...]\n  \n  Timing is critical. If we take those measures too soon, we will not\n  have the impact we need. If we take them too late, we will not reduce\n  demand [on the NHS] to the level we need\n\n\nWhat is the risk behind taking these measures - i.e. moving into the delay phase - too soon?

    "title": "Is a WHO PHEIC declaration per-area/per-country or is it always of global effect?",
    "question": "Wikipedia lets us know that:\n\n\n  A Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) is a formal declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) of \"an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response\", formulated when a situation arises that is \"serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected\", which \"carries implications for public health beyond the affected state's national border\" and \"may require immediate international action\". Under the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR), states have a legal duty to respond promptly to a PHEIC.\n  \n  [...]\n  \n  On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19, centered on Wuhan in central China, a PHEIC. [...]\n\n\nIt's unclear to me from that if a WHO PHEIC declaration (and thus the obligations following from that) are limited to an area or country that the WHO decides \"to PHEIC\" or is a PHEIC declaration on some concern, e.g. this-or-that-disease \"is PHEIC'd\" automatically entails that all IHR member countries have to respond similarly, e.g. report [all] cases of that disease. So what's the (geographical) scope of a PHEIC? Does the WHO have the latitude to \"customize it\"?\n",
    "answer_id": "50926",
    "answer": "A PHEIC declaration does not apply to a specific area - it is just that, a declaration by the WHO that the Directory-General has determined that a public health emergency of international concern exists pursuant to Article 12 of the International Health Regulation (2005). Paragraph 5 of Article 12 states that\n\n\n  If the Director-General, following consultations with the State Party\n  within whose territory the public health emergency of international\n  concern has occurred, considers that a public health emergency of\n  international concern has ended, the Director-General shall take a\n  decision in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 49.\n\n\nParagraph 6 of Article 49 states that \n\n\n  The Director-General shall communicate to States Parties the\n  determination and the termination of a public health emergency of\n  international concern, any health measure taken by the State Party\n  concerned, any temporary recommendation, and the modification,\n  extension and termination of such recommendations, together with the\n  views of the Emergency Committee.\n\n\nHere, States Parties refers to all state parties to the IHR - so any declaration of a PHEIC is therefore applicable globally, and obligates state parties to notify the WHO of any local spread of the disease. Notably, the declaration of a disease to be a PHEIC does not actually introduce new obligations to state parties directly, but as states are required under Article 6 to\n\n\n  notify WHO, by the most efficient means of communication available, by\n  way of the National IHR Focal Point, and within 24 hours of assessment\n  of public health information, of all events which may constitute a\n  public health emergency of international concern within its territory\n  in accordance with the decision instrument, as well as any health\n  measure implemented in response to those events\n\n\nthe designation of the disease to be a PHEIC means that the event is notifiable, and as a result, the declaration of a PHEIC affects all state parties by definition.\n\nHowever, if we refer back to Article 49, note that the Director-General is obligated to communicate temporary recommendations with regard to public health. These temporary recommendations are non-binding and time-limited, and are described further in Article 15, paragraph 2 of which states that\n\n\n  Temporary recommendations may include health measures to be\n  implemented by the State Party experiencing the public health\n  emergency of international concern, or by other States Parties,\n  regarding persons, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods\n  and/or postal parcels to prevent or reduce the international spread of\n  disease and avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic.\n\n\nTherefore, these temporary recommendations need not be globally applicable, and can apply to just one, or a few state parties.\n\nIn conclusion then, while the declaration of a PHEIC is applicable globally, the temporary recommendations issued as a result of the declaration are not required to be, and in general, aren't.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "Most classical liberals respect property rights as the foundation of a liberal economy. One definition of a property right is a state granted monopoly on the use of an object.\n\nMany consider John Locke the founder of classical liberalism. In a Lockean state of nature (see chapter two), people gain property rights by taking the unimproved land and putting themselves into it through labor. Once they have done this, they have a right to the land. They can voluntarily decide who enters it.\n\nCopyright law is very similar to this Lockean viewpoint. I took unused words and put my labor into it to create a story. I now have mastery over this story and may decide who uses it. \n\nCopyright law, however, has many difficulties. \n\n\nWhat if two people write the same book independently? What if someone\nelse's book is just very similar?  \nHow does copying your book harm\nyou? What about my right to do whatever I want on my property?\n\n\nBut land ownership also has many unclear difficulties as well.\n\n\nCan I play my music very loudly if it enters your land?

    "title": "Why are non-Schengen countries excluded from the Covid-19 US travel ban?",
    "question": "The US government suspended travel from Europe to US, except for countries which are not in the Schengen area such as the UK and Ireland.\n\nMany comments from EU leader seem to assume that this is a political decision rather than a health-based decision, especially with regard to this exception.\n\nIs there any official rationale for this exception?\n",
    "answer_id": "50944",
    "answer": "The official rationale, according to Trump's presidential proclamation, is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could become overwhelmed \"if sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus occurred in the United States on a large scale\". It continues:\n\n\n  The World Health Organization has determined that multiple countries\n  within the Schengen Area are experiencing sustained person-to-person\n  transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\n  \n  [...]\n  \n  The Schengen Area currently has the largest number of confirmed\n  COVID-19 cases outside of the People’s Republic of China.  As of March\n  11, 2020, the number of cases in the 26 Schengen Area countries is\n  17,442, with 711 deaths, and shows high continuous growth in infection\n  rates.  In total, as of March 9, 2020, the Schengen Area has exported\n  201 COVID-19 cases to 53 countries.  Moreover, the free flow of people\n  between the Schengen Area countries makes the task of managing the\n  spread of the virus difficult.\n  \n  The United States Government is unable to effectively evaluate and\n  monitor all of the travelers continuing to arrive from the Schengen\n  Area.  The potential for undetected transmission of the virus by\n  infected individuals seeking to enter the United States from the\n  Schengen Area threatens the security of our transportation system and\n  infrastructure and the national security.  Given the importance of\n  protecting persons within the United States from the threat of this\n  harmful communicable disease, I have determined that it is in the\n  interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend\n  the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of\n  all aliens who were physically present within the Schengen Area during\n  the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the\n  United States.\n\n\nThe reasoning exposed in the proclamation, then, is that due to the lack of travel restrictions between Schengen countries, it is far harder to manage the spread of the disease by controlling inter-Schengen migration. This factor is attributed by the proclamation as the main cause of community spread throughout the 26 member countries, and even goes as far as to tacitly blame the international spread of the disease on the area.\n\nAt a practical level, consider someone arriving to the USA from Slovenia, a member of the Schengen area. While Slovenia itself only has 31 cases currently, it is impossible for USA immigration officials to tell whether that person has just driven from Italy, which has over 10,000 cases. As a result, the Trump administration seems to have decided that the best way to deal with this issue is a blanket ban (with some exceptions, e.g. US citizens, travellers invited by the US to aid efforts against Covid-19 etc. See proclamation for full details) on travel from the Schengen area countries and visitors who have visited the area within the last 14 days, the incubation period of the disease.\n\nTravellers from a non-Schengen area, however, seem to be presumed to be able to prove that they haven't been in any Schengen countries in the last 14 days by their passport records, and as such the level of risk they pose should be able to  be more easily evaluated.\n\nHowever, as pointed out in the comments, inter-European travel does not involve passport stamping in some cases, for example from Italy to the UK, so it will be difficult to identify these travellers practically. It is unclear how immigration officials will mitigate this.\n\nThe reasoning of the proclamation, however, remains that travel restrictions could be easily imposed between, to use our example, Italy and the UK, meaning that travellers from the UK are lower risk.\n\nUpdate 14/03: The travel ban has now been extended to the UK and Ireland, which calls into question the original official rationale, but does not change it.\n",

What is happening is a buyback to inject money into the system (emphasis mine)\n\n\n  Today the Fed announced a $1.5 trillion liquidity provision to the interbank lending market — primarily in the form of “repurchase agreements.” The interbank lending market comprises the federal-funds market (in which the Fed actively participates on a daily basis) and the repurchase-agreement (or “repo”) market (in which the Fed intervenes primarily when there is a lack of liquidity). In the repo market, one financial institution temporarily trades securities to another institution, with the understanding that it will repurchase those securities in the near future (usually the next day). Banks with large balance sheets often need access to quick cash to conduct regular operations, and the most practical way to get that cash is through repos.

The WHO seems to generally aim to assist rather than punish countries.\n\nLike any individual or organization, the WHO can advocate for or against a sanction. As a UN specialized agency it is likely to be listened to by the UN assemblies.

    "question": "So far it appears that Western countries especially in Europe (e.g. Italy, Spain, UK, France, Germany) struggle to curb the spread of COVID-19. This is in contrast to most Asian countries (China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore) which were hit by the virus earlier, but managed to reduce the contagion through drastic containment measures.\n\nWhile it's probably too soon to evaluate the effect of the strong measures which have been implemented in the past few days in many European countries, it looks as if Western countries have been reluctant and/or unable and/or inefficient at implementing the methods used in Asia to fight the contagion. It also looks as if Asian countries are expected to be more disciplined and/or organized than Western countries (example).\n\nAre there any objective reasons why Western countries are less efficient than Asian countries in the fight against COVID-19?\n\nAdded: For example, are there different political choices which were made before and during the outbreak? Are there structural differences, for instance in the way governments can deploy resources in a crisis? \n",
    "answer_id": "51040",
    "answer": "Part of it is going to be that the region (HK, Singapore, SK?, China) was hit much harder during the 2003 SARS epidemic so spent more time getting prepared.\n\nAlso, it has long been the expectation that the next epidemic would come out of China, both due to population density and proximity to livestock/wild animals, so those countries could expect another \"gift\" from their Chinese neighbors.\n\nJapan?  It's relatively unscathed so far, but it is an isolated island, with comparatively few foreigners which isn't on great terms with its Asian neighbors.  As @bobsburner mentioned, \"travel density\" counts for a great deal with covid-19.  For now - counting it as luck, might become skill later.  Or its success might just be down to not-testing, as @steros says.\n\nSupply chains are in Asia.  This is being shown as an Achilles' heel of Western service-oriented economies:  if we need to ramp production of electronic testing kits or ventilators, we are cut off from a lot of the world's manufacturing capacity.\n\nCollectivism vs. individualism has a part to play in it as well:  it's more difficult for a Western politician to push drastic measures like quarantine (let alone China's dictatorial system).  Still, Italy was pretty quick to do so, because they had no choice.  Still, the cultural traits leading to quick acceptance by the community of harsh limitations on individual liberties seems to be an Asian advantage at this point:\n\nHere's a Medical Sciences Stack Exchange answer re. isolation, testing and surveillance procedures followed in Guangdong, near HK, so not Wuhan at all.  An article partly covering Wuhan itself.  And we've heard of the one-week hospitals.  We're just not there yet, in terms of mobilization. Or coercion.\n\nConstant deficit spending.  A country like Italy is at 130%+ GDP debt.  They've resisted pressure to shape up their finances, tax collection, pension payments, etc... for decades.  They just don't have anything left to surge spending in emergencies.  This applies to just too many European economies.\n\nIt's also really too early to say much about the final outcome.  Currently South Korea and China are better at getting the disease under control, but what really counts is the long run.  If a few dozen people in Wuhan spread the disease rapidly in January then we need to be ready to wait this out for a while - \"social distancing &amp; quarantines\" for 3 months, then relaxing will result in restarted epidemics.\n\nThere's also, esp. at the start, plain luck.  The 2003 SARS epidemic hit Canada's west coast less than Toronto, because a doctor got bad vibes about a patient with breathing problems and she isolated them, before any outbreak was known.  In Toronto the same type of cases mingled with the general hospital staff and patients and the outbreak was much worse.  In Italy 1 covid case was not identified as such and went to the hospital 4 times, interacting with everyone else.  S. Korea had a massive cluster early on, but it was within a religious sect, which might interact less with others.\n\nIt's hard to really assign a \"good vs bad\" label to early spread.  Past that, the quality of political leaders and their ability to balance out economic/social reality vs medical advice (which is still operating in uncertainty - witness the UK's \"herd\" approach) is going to be key.  This is a good time to be listening to experts, and there some of the Asian technocrats are a definite better bet than some of the West's populists.  I know I wouldn't be thrilled to have Duterte in the Philippines in charge, for example, and he's Asian.\n\nRather than competition and comparisons, it might be useful to see what has been achieved so far:  to some extent S. Korea and China have shown that aggressive testing and quarantines can slow the disease, Australia was very quick to sequence the bug's genome, we got a test within weeks! and some Western countries are starting to look at and evaluate candidate vaccines.

    "wrong_answer": "I can't give you a precise answer because we lack a lot of basic information, but there's a hypothesis which is worth some consideration.\n\nCOVID-19 was detected the first of December 2019, but at a fish market that couldn't possibly be the source of the new strain, it means that the virus was already going around for an unknown amount of time. Two more months passed before China decided a lockdown. So much time passed that it is possible that the epidemic was close to its peak and that most of the people were infected and had already developed the antibodies. Therefore your assumption you base the question on, that the Western countries are struggling more than China, might not be correct.\n\nEdit:\n\nI see that you changed your title and you changed the assumption from the Western countries struggling more than China to the Asian countries that seem to be more efficient than the European countries. This changes the subject and the meaning of my answer. While the previous assumption was dubious, but more precise, the second is confused and full of implications difficult to prove: \n\nWhen you say that Asian countries seem to be more efficient are you implying that all of them where affected in the same way and reacted in the same way? There is an enormous amount of differences among them. Japan and South Korea contained the spread more easily. But why? Did they interacted more with Chinese people coming from other regions? Was it due to better weather conditions? Was it due to the hygienic conditions that already existed there independently from the epidemic? There are a lot of variables here. But then How can you relate Japan with a country like India where the hygiene condition are worse, but the weather conditions are a lot more difficult for a virus like an influenza?\n\nFurthermore we know almost nothing about what happened and what is happening in countries like Iran, does your question also imply that Iran seem to be more efficient than Western countries?\n",

    "title": "Why are Central Banks cutting interest rates in response to COVID-19?",
    "question": "Central Banks around the world have cut interest rates in the past few days in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the US Federal Reserve (0-0.25%), the Bank of England (0.1%), and the Reserve Bank of Australia (0.25%). Notably, the European Central Bank has not yet cut interest rates further, but this is partly because it is already in the negatives, at -0.5%.\n\nWhy are central banks taking this measure in response to this pandemic in particular - i.e. how does this measure lessen the pandemic's economic impact - and what are the impacts on the average consumer of a cut in their country's central bank interest rate in general?\n",
    "answer_id": "51096",
    "answer": "By lowering interest rates the Fed's main goal is to prop up the stock market, and support US corporations.\n\nThis is achieved through the following effects:\n- it encourages credit creation through bank lending, and because most money originates in credit it makes money cheaper and more widely available\n- it lowers the rates of return on savings and thus encourages savers to spend more freely, which has a twofold effect: it stimulates the economy into the creation of yet more loans, and it tells savers to go elsewhere with their money\n\nThe resulting availability of money/credit and lowered bank savings rates makes the stock market an attractive destination.\n\nSince 2007, the financial crisis, the Fed is essentially a hostage of the stock market in that if now must keep loose monetary policy to further the illusion of perpetual long term stock market gains. This is further evidenced by the tentative and then aborted QT (quantitive tightening) attempt last year. \n\nIn the current climate of coronavirus economic meltdown, the lowered interest rate has a further goal: to help protect US corporations who are now overstretched on corporate bonds.\n\nSince 2007, unbeknownst to many, and I think illegal outside the US (?) , corporations  - rather than restructure in the wake of the crisis - regularly take advantage of the cheap money stimulus by issuing corporate bonds (essentially borrowing money at low rates) so that their execs can use this to direct the company to purchase its own stock on the stock market. This creates the illusion of rising corporate value while allowing shareholders to receive big dividends and CEOs to pay themselves income related bonuses.\n\nThis irresponsible corporate behaviour has brought US corporations to the point that the coronavirus meltdown has slowed earnings below what they need to pay on the corporate bonds. Without direct government support many US corporations will go bust, and corporate bond prices will plummet, which will trigger further meltdown in financial institutions that invest in those assets.\n\nAgain, silently under the media radar, just this week the US (?) and ECB created new funds that will be directed to supply money to those institutions buying corporate bonds. To be clear, the way that works is that bondholders who are now nervous about the corporation defaulting might not roll over their bond....rather than reacquiring bonds at the end of their term, or even ending prematurely, they will demand their money from the corps. The corps. don't have it, but new bonds will be sold to the govt backed funds. (Once again the taxpayer bails out the fatcat)\n\nSo in summary, the reduced interest rate in combo with new funds, is designed to prop up the stock market and corporations to prevent socioeconomic collapse.\n\nAround the world, central banks lower the rate for the effects of stimulus and stock market prop-up described above. ECB does not lower because the negative interest rate actually makes loans more expensive in some cases as being paid to borrow makes it easier than to lend.\n",

    "question": "Japan is currently the nation with the highest debt as a percentage of GDP - at the time of writing it stands at over 250%. Greece, currently the second most indebted nation, went through a decade-long debt crisis after the 2008 financial crash. It entered this crisis with debt levels of 'only' 103% of GDP, and over the entire debt crisis, this only increased to 181% of GDP.\n\nHow is Japan able to withstand this level of debt without entering a debt crisis similar to Greece? Is this the right metric to look at, or are there other factors specific to either country?\n",
    "answer_id": "51105",
    "answer": "Their economies are radically different otherwise.\n\n\nGreece has a weak economy in most fields, with the exception of tourism.  Japan is a manufacturing and scientific powerhouse.\nGreece runs recurring high deficits and had rarely, if ever, shown inclination to stop doing so.  While Japan was criticized at the start of their financial decline for insisting on balanced budgets instead of stimulating demand.\nTax collection.  Japan does it.  Greece didn't.\nJapan could devaluate its currency if necessary to adjust its finances.  Greece couldn't, being on the euro.\nJapanese government debt is, I believe, mostly owed to Japanese investors and denominated in yen, unlike Greece's.\nJapan has demonstrated for decades that it can pay its bills, on its own.  Greece on the other hand just seemed as if the only thing that kept it up was euro membership.\nGreek official statistics were not, and had not for a while, been trusted.  They're still prosecuting the guy who showed they were cooking the books.\n\n\nUntil 2008, Greece was only getting charged a 0.25% point premium over German bonds based on the tacit assumption that Europe (Euro-zone) would never let Greece go broke. Investors, out of greed and risk un-awareness (or trust in European taxpayers gullibility), parked their money in Greek bonds, rather than German ones, just to get that extra 0.25% point.\n\nFrom https://www.bankofgreece.gr/Publications/Annrep1999.pdf (I find it hard to set hard time limits on Google to only look at stuff from before a date):\n\n\n  Specifically, the yield differential between the Greek and the German 10-year\n  bond fell from roughly 270 basis points at end-1998 to about 200 basis points in March\n  1999 (see Chart VI.1).\n\n\nAt the start of the general crisis, investors started wondering if trusting that Europe would always back Greek debt, even when undergoing a Europe-wide crisis, was a wise idea.  Once perception soured, the game was up very quickly.  Financing costs for Greek government debt went up, fast.  Any refinancing happened at progressively higher rates.  A debt that looked bad at the previous, lower, rate seemed like it would result in a short term default.  People still loaned to Greece, but the premium to do so was massive and made this very quickly unsustainable.\n\nThe plug was pulled, late high-rate private and non-European investors got a haircut.  Europe's taxpayers paid up enough money for Greece to keep paying slightly lowered interests, at deferred times, to the big German and French banks so they wouldn't take too massive a loss (and so that loss of confidence wouldn't spread, as per @Machavity answer).\n\nMost Greek debt remained in place, unlike what happens in say an Argentinian default.  In fact, money \"helpfully\" loaned to keep Greece from defaulting on interest payments just got added to the overall debt.  In a way, though it fully deserved the initial mess it got, that's the tragedy of Greece.  Instead of the reset that comes with a default, Greeks got this unending misery of servicing a debt which is only pretended to be fully recoverable from (as most of my post is critical, I want to stress that, IMHO, the Greek people don't deserve to live through this for decades).\n\nBut no one is too willing to put their hands in that wolf's jaws anymore.\n\nAs o.m. says, mostly perception. Until COVID-19 at least, Japan looks like it has a few good years left for investors, most of whom are Japanese and have little interest in rocking the boat.  This is not to say it is financially healthy, only that it is under less external pressure.\n\nGreece relies on foreign money, didn't look good in 2008 and doesn't now.  In most other conditions, big chunks of that 181% would have been written off as unrecoverable already.\n",

    "question": "In the middle of the Covid-19 lockdown, at least in France and in Italy newsagents are in the list of first-necessity stores that remain open. \"To go buy a newspaper\" is a legitimate reason to leave one's house.\n\nI wonder about the motivations of this decision: buying a newspaper is not essential by any definition of the term. Television, radio and internet are largely sufficient to cover the need for information of the general population.\n\nIs there a reasonable political explanation for this? At first sight, it seems that the only one is the ties and the balance of power between politicians and news outlets / medias.\n",
    "answer_id": "51109",
    "answer": "At least in Italy, this appears to be in part a response to pressure from newspapers and their readers. On March 11th, the director of la Repubblica newspaper Carlo Verdelli published (in Italian) an article asking for newsagents to be included in the list of essential services, saying that \"The list is missing a service that is more fundamental \n now than ever before, that of information\". He went on to state that \"If [newsagents] were not included in the list, it would cause irreparable damage, not only for newspapers, but most importantly for the citizenry.\" (my translation)\n\nThis is an important point, as a study undertaken by the Pew Research Center in 2017 found that while TV and online media dominate, 31% of Italians and 23% of French adults get their news from print media at least daily. This group is likely to be composed of older citizens who will be most affected if they contract the virus, and although this puts them at more risk if they leave their houses to buy a newspaper, it is of higher importance to keep at-risk groups informed. \n\nIn addition, another Pew Research Center study found that newspapers were especially important for coverage of local news that would not otherwise be reported in alternative media - although the study was limited to the US, this is another potential factor that could have influenced the decision.\n\nIt seems that France and Italy have decided that informing the populace is especially important in this time of crisis, and that this outweighs the threat public health and the potential spread of disease that the inclusion of newsagents as an essential service poses.\n",

This will tend to distract them from discontent over their living conditions, the steady concentration of power and wealth in the government and its immediate allies, and so on. \n\nWe don't know how healthy the Russian strategic deterrent is\n\nThe government is short of money, but they have a lot of missiles to maintain.\n\nIt's a negotiating strategy\n\nIf they make a fuss about a missile defence system, they might be able to get some concession in exchange for accepting it. \n\nThe Russians don't regard the Iranian threat as credible\n\nThe missile defence systems installed in Poland a decade ago were explicitly for defence against Iranian missiles. The Russians didn't regard that threat as credible, mainly because they feel that the Iranian government is somewhat rational and capable of being deterred by US strategic weapons, and by French and UK SLBMs. \n\nSo they don't see any threat that that the missile defence system could be used against, apart from Russia. \n\nThey suspect the missile defence system can be rapidly strengthened\n\nOne claimed reason why the missile defence system \"can't be intended for use against Russia\" is that the numbers of missiles are too small to make a significant difference.

Is there a problem in the way COVID-19 has been nicknamed?\n",
    "answer_id": "51122",
    "answer": "Let's appreciate the learning curve. The problem with all of those historical names is that they created sharp spikes in prejudice, social ostracism, and violence against the indicated groups, and still create issues today as seen here with COVID-19. It's true that the first identified cases of Covid-19 occurred in Wuhan China, but this does not imply that people of Chinese descent — or even people recently emigrated from China — are vectors for the disease, or in any way responsible for the problems that the disease causes. But in the minds of an unfortunate number of ignorant people, the mere association of the disease with Chinese heritage can produce verbal and physical assaults, and/or other social pressures that can prevent Chinese people in any walk of life from getting access to necessities or essential services. \n\nTrump's very public insistence on calling this the 'Chinese virus', backed by his status as president, is guaranteed to significantly increase acts of discrimination and assault on people of Asian descent (whether or not they are specifically Chinese). It guarantees this merely by giving an authoritative affirmation to the most panicked, emotional, and ignorant portion of our society that those 'Chinese' are in some way responsible for the spread of Covid-19.\n\nNo doubt Trump does this intentionally. Trump thrives on the panicked, angry ignorance of others; that emotional state he knows how to manipulate to his own profit. And while he himself may not be concerned with the secondary impact of increased violence against people of Asian descent, people of Asian descent have a good deal to worry about.\n\nA president ought to have the presence of mind not to inflame racial tensions in a situation where tensions are already running exceedingly high. Even if we wanted to argue that there is nothing terribly wrong with the phrasing in and of itself — that it's just a poor choice of words by a man whom no one considers to be eloquent, perhaps — misstatements by someone who is (ostensibly) the leader of the free world have significant consequences. If even one Asian American gets attacked because of someone emboldened by Trump's poor word choice, that is blood on Trump's hands.\n",

Proposing an amendment requires two thirds of both houses of Congress or two thirds of the legislatures of the states. Democrats do not control two thirds of either house, nor do they control two thirds of state legislatures.

    "answer_id": "51134",
    "answer": "Usually, the Trump administration referred to the virus as \"coronavirus\", \"the coronavirus\", or, more commonly in press releases and official documents, the official WHO name of  \"COVID-19\". The response team headed by VP Mike Pence was termed the \"Coronavirus Task Force\", for example.\n\nThere are however, instances prior to March 12th, when the allegations were tweeted by a Chinese official for the first time, where a location was attached to the disease. \n\nAs far back as the start of February, White House chief economic advisor Larry Kudlow described the virus as \"the Chinese virus\" in an interview with Fox Business Network.\n\nMike Pompeo and Republican Senators &amp; Representatives repeatedly used the term \"Wuhan Virus\" in press briefings and in debates in the weeks leading up to the 12th. On the 9th, GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted a link to the CDC website, saying that it offered \"Everything you need to know about the Chinese coronavirus\".\n\nOn March 10th, Trump retweeted a tweet by Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, which calls the virus \"China Virus\" and says that \"the US stands a chance if we can control of our borders\"(sic). In his address on March 11th which announced the travel ban to Schengen countries, Trump described the disease as a \"foreign virus\".\n\nIt should be noted that this is not specific to the Trump administration, indeed, before March, many media outlets also included a geographic adjective in their reporting, including the BBC, the Guardian, Al Jazeera, the Financial Times, Reuters, Scientific American, the Associated Press, the Global Times, and the Washington Post, amongst others. This term then fell out of use towards the end of February, as this analysis by Axios shows, being replaced by the WHO sanctioned terms. \n\nIn conclusion, then, while US administration officials usually used the term \"coronavirus\", or the medical term \"COVID-19\", there was significant use of a geographic adjective, be that \"China\", \"Chinese\", or \"Wuhan\". While this was not initially exclusive to conservative politicians or administration officials, in the last couple of weeks in response to many claims that the term is racist, offensive, and inaccurate, this language has become far less popular, and now is used in the US almost solely by Republican officials &amp; conservative media outlets, and has become far more frequently used by these individuals.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "The dominant American Foreign policy is some variation of \"The Monroe Doctrine\" which is best summed up as \"If you want to start trouble, you are not starting it here.\" And the military has largely been set up to enforce this.  In the early days, this was quite easy as America really only had to maintain a small military force to counter European and Native American threats on the mainland, both were not to powerful... and if war broke out, reinforcements were difficult to get to the Americas before the US could increase its own forces.  The U.S. Civil war still remains the bloodiest war fought in the hemisphere with Gettysburg being the biggest battle in the hemisphere to date.\n\nUp until the end of WWII, the United States had only ever participated in a war as a defender nation (or presumed defender when they made the declaration, such as the Spanish-American War).  The reigning political thought was \"It's not our problem unless they make it our problem.\"  This changed with the cold war as Communism was deemed antithetical to the American ideals and had a mission statement of global communism.  The US invested heavily in preventing the spread, which was the goal of political Communist thinking.  Again, this isn't so much opposed to Monroe Doctrine as the goal was preventing Communism from reaching the Americas.  It's telling that the closest the U.S. ever got to declaring Nuclear War was when Russia started deploying Nukes to Cuba and the nation collectively lost its mind.\n\nThe US was able to ultimately win in while they had an irrational fear of the Communism, The Soviet Union had a very rational fear of the United States.  After all, they are the only nation to use a nuclear weapon in war.  And we didn't really hate the Japanese people's way of life when we were in that war.  But we hated Communism.\n\nSo the U.S. kept up military spending to scare off a Soviet Attack... and the Soviet Union tried to keep up with us.  (The Soviets never had the edge in the \"Bomber Gap\" and only briefly had it in the \"Missile Gap\" but they were much better at hiding this and had the U.S. convinced they had better missiles and more bombers than the U.S. did).  It became a game of chicken that eventually forced the Soviet Union into defeat as they couldn't keep up with U.S. spending, having been hit by several food shortages, the Afghanistan War, and Chernobyl.\n\nThis strategy has actually been able to protect the most important asset in the US military arsenal:  The Troops, very well.  In it's entire history which doesn't have a lack of war in it, The United States has lost about 2.7 million to casualties of War (Both wounded and unable to fight and killed) in its entire history.  Compare with the Soviet Union, which had lost about 2.9 million people to non-death related causalities in WWII alone.  By these numbers the United States is expected to lose an annual average 11,500 people to Death of War, which sounds like a lot, except that the average rate of deaths from civilian automobile accidents is around 40,000 per year in the US.\n\nThe U.S. Public wants to the military to do two things:  Keep the enemies \"over there\" where they belong and to send home as few of their troops in boxes as possible.  To do this, they are willing to put more money into the military than similarly developed nations.\n\nAs mentioned in comments, this has also meant that a large portion of the US economy is driven by the military.  In fact, it's not uncommon for entire communities to become Ghost Towns when the local military base is closed down for budget reasons.\n",

Senator Elizabeth Warren, until recently a 2020 presidential candidate, told reporters that \"We're not here to create a slush fund for Donald Trump and his family, or a slush fund for the Treasury Department to be able to hand out to their friends\".\n\nThe summary of the bill, however, states that it provides funding for small businesses and individuals, which would seem to benefit the average person, and includes a raft of healthcare provisions, including \"additional funding for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19\", and \"limits [on] liability for volunteer health care professionals\" in order to help fight the disease.\n\nWhich provisions in the bill specifically are opponents of the bill objecting to? Which measures are seen as benefiting corporate America over individuals?\n",

    "answer": "Democrats have been trying to make the case that the stimulus package contains within it a corporate \"slush fund\" controlled by the Treasury Department and headed by Steve Mnuchin, and Democrats believe there is a high risk of mismanagement or outright corruption. From NYMag:\n\n\n  The central flash point concerns a $500 billion corporate bailout. [...] \n  Its requirements that bailed-out firms protect their workers are too weak. (Protecting the workers is the whole rationale for bailing them out, after all — at least from the Democrats’ point of view.) More disturbing, it’s designed as a pool of money to be doled out by the Treasury secretary. That is to say, the money is, for all intents and purposes, personally controlled by Donald Trump, who selected the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, and could replace him on a whim. [...]\n  One obvious outcome of this financing arrangement would be to create the all-but-certain outcome that the Treasury would select the Trump Organization as one of the worthy recipients of its largesse. Trump’s vacation properties have indeed been forced to shut down, and while an unbiased manager might not select the Trump Organization over needier coronavirus victims, Trump himself probably thinks differently. Indeed, at his press conference, the president did not even bring himself to deny that he might. “Let’s just see what happens,” he replied, as if the outcome might contain any mystery.\n\n\nThey also make the argument that the restrictions on the bailout fund that are in place to prevent some of the excesses by executives after the bailout of 2008 are weak, as are protections for workers who become unemployed. From Politico:\n\n\n  According to a senior Democratic aide, the party's concerns with the GOP proposal center on $500 billion for corporations; stock buyback language that can be waived by the Treasury secretary; only a two-year time frame on executive compensation limits; and no provisions to protect individuals from eviction. [...] Democrats also object to what they say is an insufficient amount of money for state and local governments and providing only three months of unemployment insurance. Democrats initially asked for $750 billion in state aid, and Republicans have countered with far less.\n\n\nA further complication for the bill is the behavior by many of these firms and how they chose to spend money saved by the GOP tax cut. Instead of using that money to create rainy day funds, they instead used that money to repurchase stock in order to inflate executive compensation to the detriment of their workers.\n",

One common example form is an administrative (Executive Branch; state or federal) regulation that proffers an adhesion contract to an individual which provides for penalty (potentially imprisonment without the citizen having been charged with or convicted of a crime) for either refusing to accept or consider the contract, or purportedly violating the adhesion contract.\n",

    "answer": "Max Rissuto from DFRLab has analysed this in an article published on March 17th which tests the media bias claims made by Republican politicians including GOP House Leader Kevin McCarthy, who tweeted that \"Democrats are trying to score political points by calling Republicans racist\" and that the \"media called it 'Chinese coronavirus' for weeks\". While McCarthy uses the term 'Chinese coronavirus', Rissuto's analysis also includes the term 'Wuhan Virus'. It should be noted however that this analysis was performed on all English language publications, not just US-targeted media, and has only collected data up until March 10th.\n\nDFRLab conducted a series of queries using a media monitoring tool to test the claim that media organizations are acting hypocritically in this way, gathering information about how geographic adjectives were used by the media to describe the disease before the official name of \"COVID-19\" was applied by the WHO. This data is summarized in the chart below.\n\n\n(Source: @MaxBRizzuto/DFRLab)\n\nFrom this data, we can see that the terms 'Wuhan Virus' &amp; 'Wuhan Coronavirus' both had widespread use in English language media from the end of January up until the WHO named the disease on February 11th. The usage was comparable to the usage of the terms 'China Virus', and less commonly, 'Chinese Coronavirus'. After this date, we see the usage fall away dramatically, albeit not entirely, up until the recent debacle surrounding the use of geographic adjectives by various US and international politicians. This could also be due to the fact that as the virus spread throughout China, publications that would have used 'Wuhan Virus' found 'China Virus' to be more accurate.\n\nIn conclusion then, while a significant proportion of articles used the term 'Wuhan Virus' prior to naming conventions for the disease being established, after this point most media outlets switched to using the official terminology. The usage of the term has seen a resurgence in the media recently due in part to publications reporting on some politician's continued use of this terminology.\n",

Police still need to get a search warrant to investigate the crime for several reasons, including:\n\n\nPolice could uncover evidence of other crimes, perhaps committed by other individuals living or associated with the deceased in some way.  That evidence would be inadmissible against the still living offenders without a proper search warrant.\nCriminals, especially in violent crimes like this one typically are associated with their victims in some way.  For example, the suspect is believed to have killed his mother in this case.  An unwarranted search in this case could unnecessarily violate the rights of several of the victims as well.\nThe deceased is still only a suspect.  Again, in this very case the press originally identified the wrong person as the suspect.  It could yet turn out (however unlikely that may be) that the suspect was just another victim and without following the proper procedures, the real murderer may never come to justice.\n\n\nIt is often times frustrating to see these types of activities eat up valuable time in the pursuit of a criminal, but given the closeness with which we interact with other people and the seriousness with which we protect and value our privacy, it is important that our justice system operate blindly, even boringly, in its even handed pursuit of the truth.\n",

    "question": "Romania has declared a state of emergency because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has a few effects. Two of which I consider relevant for this questions are:\n\n\nthey limit some of people's rights (like the right to move freely, for ex);\nsome decisions can badly affect certain categories of people (lose jobs, unable to get access to care, difficulty in access food, for ex).\n\n\nOld people are the most affected and in extreme situations. They might die not because of the virus, but because of decisions that are taken to slow down the progression of the virus, like being unable to access care, or medicine, or food because people are restricted in what they can do and health services are restricted in what cases they treat.\n\nMy question is this: If Romanian politicians take bad decisions, or police and military enforce bad decisions and this causes deaths that could have been avoided if they had more... \"common sense\" let's say... after the state of emergency ends, are they accountable for their actions? Or does anything go during a state of emergency with no consequences for those in power?\n",
    "answer_id": "51186",
    "answer": "The general answer to this, which applies in most democratic countries, is that governments are not legally responsible for \"bad\" decisions, whether made during a state of emergency or not. The main reasons for this are:\n\n\nWho is to say what is a \"bad\" decision? It's rarely obvious, even with 20/20 hindsight, and the general view is that the electorate is responsible for deciding, which means:\nthe redress for governments who make bad decisions is that at the next election the people will vote them out.\n\n\nThat said, a state of emergency does not mean \"anything goes\". Governments are still responsible for illegal actions. If a government ordered random shootings of innocent people in the street that would still be illegal, even in a state of emergency, and any soldier who carried out such an action could be prosecuted. A state of emergency extends what is legal, but doesn't extend it indefinitely. It might be legal to force the closure of businesses in a state of emergency, but not to kill random people.\n",

    "question": "In the US Senate on Sunday, March 22nd, passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was blocked in a 47-47 vote. The vote was generally along party lines, with one exception: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell voted against the cloture measure alongside the Democrats, despite arguing forcefully for the passage of the bill. I've noticed this with other bills and with Harry Reid before McConnell, so it's not just this bill – it seems like a more common pattern.\n\nWhy would the Senate Majority leader vote against cloture on a bill that they support? Is it a procedural issue?\n",
    "answer_id": "51187",
    "answer": "While looking for more examples of this process, I stumbled upon the answer.  \n\nWhy is Harry Reid always voting against his own plans?\n\n\n  Forty U.S. senators voted to block a final vote on Chuck Hagel's nomination to be defense secretary. Of those, 39 were Republicans opposed to the nomination, at least for the moment. The other was Harry Reid. It wasn't that Reid opposed Hagel — far from it. ...\n  \n  So what gives? In articles like the one I wrote on the Hagel filibuster, the short explanation we give is that Reid voted no \"for procedural reasons\" or because a no vote \"allows him to bring another cloture vote in the future.\" ...\n  \n  As Sarah Binder, a Senate rules expert at George Washington University, told me, it's not that the majority leader has to vote no. It's that somebody on the winning side of the cloture vote — in this case, the side voting against cloture — has to file a \"motion to reconsider\" if the matter is to be taken up again. \"I suppose the broader parliamentary principle here is that it would be somewhat unfair to give someone on the losing side of a question a second bite at the apple,\" Binder explains. So the rules provide for senators whose opinion has changed to motion for another vote, whereas those whose opinion stays the same don't get to keep filing to reconsider.\n  \n  Reid, and other majority leaders before him, have developed a clever workaround: Just change your vote at the last minute if it looks as though you're going to lose, then move to reconsider. In theory, any supporter of the bill or nomination in question could do the same, but traditionally it's been the majority leader.\n\n\nSenate rules say that after a failed cloture vote (ie. the bill did not get the 60 votes needed to overrule a filibuster), a \"Motion to Reconsider\" (that is, a second attempt at cloture) can only be called by a member of the winning side of the vote.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "tl;dr> Correlation != Causation.\n\nThe difficulty in achieving any statistically relevant study is that you only have one data point - namely the expansion of all colonial empires correlated with the time period of the Mercator projection.  Thus, strictly speaking, you only have one degree of freedom in terms of data, constraining you to one exogenous variable.  That is simply insufficient to construct any type of model that has any residual explanatory power.  \n\nPrior to the Mercator projection, you only had Ptolemy's Maps which were based on star sightings, and were accurate as far as latitude was concerned, but not longitude.  As such, there was no scientifically rigorous way of approximating land area in visual form.  For this reason, after Herschel's clock enabled longitude to be reckoned with precision for the first time, the King of France could decry the loss of 20% of his empire (which had been calculated based on approximations of longitude, rather than reality.) But, to ascribe to Ptomley the propagandistic effect of exaggerating longitude in order to enhance the Kingdom of France would be laughable, not least of the reasons of which are that Ptolemy's purpose was simply to arrange cities north to south and to make a best guess at east west relations.  \n\nAnd, while Ptolemy had Erothanes' best guess as to the measure of the earth, there is not as much evidence that Mercator did, not that he particularly would have cared. Mercator's goal was to make the lives of the sea captians easier. \n\nThe fact of the matter with regards to the Peters-Gall Projection, or any other projection for that matter, is that the creators of any map do have a point that a bias is inherent to the visualization. And indeed, Mark Monomer's How to Lie With Maps cites many persuasive pieces of propoganda that have been used throughout the years. But, to attribute a propagandistic motive to Mercator is an accusation after the fact.  As pointed out, Mercator's projection allowed for simple dead reckoning by sailors.  If it had an unintended propagandistic side effect, that is not documented nor is it statistically testable.\n\nThus to answer the question directly, yes, in fact, on 100% of the earth's using the Mercator Projection, it is correlated with a group of nations that were colonial empires in nature.  And, in 100% of the earth's prior to it, you also had colonial empires, such as Rome, China, the Maya and Aztec, the Indus, etc... Whether or not it is causative, however, lies beyond the realm of statistics to answer, because there is simply an insufficient number of earth's to reproduce the hypothesis.\n",

    "question": "A part of this answer got me wondering if another state can request compensations over the huge economical cost of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics:\n\n\n  (..) the region (HK, Singapore, SK?, China) was hit much harder during the 2003 SARS epidemic so spent more time getting prepared.\n  \n  (..) it has long been the expectation that the next epidemic would come out of China, both due to population density and proximity to livestock/wild animals, so those countries could expect another \"gift\" from their Chinese neighbors.\n\n\nTheoretically it can be argued that China could have tackle \"the proximity to livestock/wild animals\" to avoid another pandemic. \n\nIs it possible for a country to ask for compensation over a pandemic started in another country. Or a pandemic is assimilated to a naturally occurring event regardless of context?\n\nQuestion: Is it possible for a country to ask for compensation over damage done by SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that most likely started in China?\n",
    "answer_id": "51254",
    "answer": "First, let's address the biological point. China is not 'responsible' for this novel coronavirus or the pandemic it is generating. Viruses are constantly mutating, and all it takes to begin an epidemic is for one person to encounter one animal that has a mutated strain of a virus, a strain which can jump species and start transmitting itself human to human. Humans are social creatures; they will have social contact and pass the strain on to others. Of course, being in a densely packed region with exposure to livestock increases the odds of that kind of encounter and maximizes the rate of transmission — lots of people nearby to infect, so the disease doesn't have to work its way outward — but that is a condition of poverty as much as anything else. People living on marginal incomes will pack together and bring their livestock with them, because they cannot afford the luxuries of personal space or shipped-in food.\n\nAnd frankly, while poverty exacerbates diseases, it does not create them. The next pandemic could just as easily start because some well-to-do American on his country estate gets shat on by an infected bird. Novel infections are a natural phenomenon. We are not immune to the workings of nature (despite our pretensions) so epidemics will happen on a rare but regular basis. Blaming a particular region for a pandemic is like blaming your neighbor because you got crabgrass in your lawn. Crabgrass doesn't know, or care, whose lawn it is.\n\nThis 'neighbor' example is a good analogy for the problem this question faces. Currently, all states are treated as sovereign, like a neighborhood of houses in which each homeowner has absolute say over what he gets to do with his house and yard. There is no overarching governance: no courts, no police, no administrators, no higher authority to appeal to, to force a neighbor to do this or that on his property. The UN is like a town hall in which people come together to argue and make resolutions, but it has no real teeth except as individual sovereigns agree to abide by its decisions. This leaves only a few options on the table:\n\n\nShrug and ignore what other sovereign homeowners do on their own turf, implicitly accepting the bad things that might float over the fence into one's own yard (i.e., the status quo).\nTry to create agreements that commit all parties to certain kinds of behavior (i.e. pacts and treaties): a slow and difficult process to begin with, and one that any sovereign can back out of at any convenient-for-them time.\nRestrict the ability of particular sovereign homeowners to interact with the community, in the hopes that deprivation will force them into compliance (i.e., sanctions, embargoes, etc.).\nCreate independent, unaligned groups that ask permission to enter another's sovereign territory to solve particular problems before they spread (i.e, NGO's and such). Note that sovereign homeowners are under no obligation to allow such groups access, and can interfere with such groups' work in any way they desire.\nForce your way onto another's sovereign territory to solve the problem against that sovereign's will (i.e., war).\n\n\nSo long as we maintain the decrepit ideal of sovereign nations, there's not much we can do to prevent the spread of a disease through a nation and across its borders. There is nothing at all we can do to prevent the birth of a novel disease. And unless we are willing to address underlying social issues like poverty and overpopulation, we are as much to blame as anyone else for pandemics of this sort, so there is no point in trying to collect 'compensation' for some imagined wrongdoing we project onto others.\n",

    "title": "What measures has Romania taken to contain the returning diaspora?",
    "question": "News about Romania's COVID-19-driven, reverse diaspora:\n\n\n  Over 200,000 Romanians who worked abroad have returned to the country since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, with many of them coming from those EU countries strongly affected by the pandemic, PM Ludovic Orban said on Friday [March 27].\n  \n  “On February 25 there was only one case in Romania, two cases of coronavirus in Spain, and several others in France. Look at the number of cases in Romania, less over 1,000, and if we also take into the account the cured ones, we have below 1,000 patients with COVID-19, while there are tens of thousands of infections in other countries. Romania has taken serious measures from the start”, the premier stated.\n  \n  Besides, he underlined that Romania had another particularity as against the other countries, namely that over 200,000 Romanians from Diaspora returned to the homeland. “If we had not taken severe containment measures, be it quarantine or isolation, the spread would have been larger”, Orban added.\n\n\nHow did Romania manage to quarantine 200,000 people returning from abroad (if I understand correctly that's what they did)? What specific enforcement measures did they take?\n",
    "answer_id": "51275",
    "answer": "I don't have a complete list of all the measures taken, but in large strokes, the following things happened:\n\n\nschools were closed very soon after the first cases of covid-19 were discovered;\nlarge gatherings of people were prohibited (not more than 100, then after some period not more than 50);\na state of emergency was declared when there were relatively few cases of infections compared to the population number;\na lot of local districts started to take actions on their own, like closing public parks.\nthe private sector also took action. Companies encouraged employees to work from home, sporting events were canceled, stores changed their program or limit the number of shoppers at any given time, hypermarkets started to disinfect their shopping carts and protect their cashiers with glass windows, trains in the subway station would pull only one by one at the platform to limit the number of passengers that would gather together.\nbecause a state of emergency was declared, new laws were passed to control what people were doing. First there were restrictions to be on the streets between 22:00 and 06:00. This lasted for a few days, then restrictions were put in place all day. Now or example you are not allowed to exit the home unless for some specific reasons like buying food, seek medical help, take care of elderly people, go to work, and a few others. People above 65 are not allowed to go out of their home unless they have an emergency. For other activities they are only allowed to go out between 11:00 and 13:00. Stores reinforce this by allowing only the elderly to shop in that time interval. Now all parks are closed. And groups of more than 3 people are disallowed. All shops and malls that don't sell food or things you need to survive were closed.\n\n\nThese are a few things that happened since the whole covid-19 cases started to happen in Romania.\n\nNow, to your question. Because we are in a state of emergency the law was changed to account for the pandemic situation. If you have returned from abroad you need to go into self-isolation or you are placed under quarantine (for 14 days if I remember correctly). You are not allowed to leave your house and friends, family or couriers must provide you with food and supplies. You don't interact with them, they just leave them at the door. If you do not respect these measures, the fines are now very large, up to 20000 RON (more than 4000 EUR), and you can also go to jail. If you breach self-isolation or quarantine and you are discovered, you are being placed under military guard so you don't do it again.\n\nNow, with that being said, you can't really monitor 200000 people or keep them in check. There are controls, but you can't really keep them isolated. Many were discovered wondering the streets, going to parties, visiting friends, etc by the authorities. It helps I guess that there is some panic and people will report those that they know came from abroad and are not sitting put (mothers have reported their children to the authorities, for examples).\n\nSo basically that's what's happening right now. We have lower cases of infections than other countries because everyone reacted quickly and took measures before things were bad. Because movement is restricted this limits contact between persons. People also isolated themselves in the houses by precaution before the state of emergency was declared (for example, a few days before the state of emergency was declared, people hit the stores and bought all the flour and yeast, rice, canned produce, etc to stay in home for weeks) because of worry, fear, panic.\n\nFor further reference, some details on the infection in Romania:\n\nhttps://instnsp.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/5eced796595b4ee585bcdba03e30c127\n\n(on the left, in red are the total confirmed cases, in yellow are persons under quarantine, blue is people in isolation at home, in gray are the number of deceased people)\n\nMy belief is that authorities panicked when they saw what was happening in Italy for example (many Romanians live there and return for Easter Holiday each year) so they took harsh measures before  it was needed. It seems it helped. Although they also took some bad decisions like limiting access to information (in the name of having it from official sources). I don't remember exactly, but I think that link above is from independently collected data, as authorities no longer report cases per district, but only globally.\n\nEDIT: as a response to your comment I've looked up a few examples in the media:\n\n1. In the first day of restrictions of circulation, 5,621 persons who did not comply with the measures were fined 7,404,297 RON (1,531,965 EUR). That's an average of 1,317 RON (272 EUR) per person.\n\n2. In later news, the number of people who did not comply with the restrictions of circulation and were fined increased to 23,973, and an amount of 31,400,000 RON (6,496,730 EUR). That's an average of 1309 RON (270 EUR) per person. The same news mentions that for 209 persons a criminal record was opened and 4,235 were fined for non-compliance with the isolation/quarantine measures.\n\n3. The news in point 2 did not mention how much the fines were for those that did not comply with isolation/quarantine, but in older news, 10 days ago, on the Ministry of Health's website it was stated that 1,835,000 RON (379,665 EUR) of fines were applied to 120 persons for not respecting the measure of isolation. That's an average of 15,291 RON (3,163 EUR) per person.\n\nSo the fines for breaking isolation/quarantine are quite large (plus getting a criminal record for more severe situations). For reference, the minimum net wage in Romania is 1,346 RON (278 EUR) while the average net wage is 3,189 RON (659 EUR). So for a large number of people, the fines are quite large. \n",

The Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman religion is the sole religion of the state. All other forms of worship now existing are tolerated in conformity with the law.\n\n\nNot the most enticing wording, but vague enough to allow for a claim of Church-State separation.\nThe rest of the Treaty simply does not address the Church-State issue. It is basically a recognition of Italy of the Vatican as an independent country2. It is a State-State treaty. Other than allowing travel and residence rights to Vatican \"citizens\" and some minor points, there are no obligations beyond international laws.\n\n\nConcordat\n\nThe Concordat is the true Church-State treaty. And it includes things like:\n\n\n  Art. 5 No Ecclesiastic may be employed or remain in the employment of an office of the Italian State or any public entity depending from the same without the nihil obstat of the Diocesan ordinary.\n\n\nSo the Church says to the State if he can hire or not priests and the like...\n\n\n  Art. 20. Bishops before taking possession of their dioceses shall take an oath of fidelity to the head of the State according to the following formula\n\n\nArt. 34 says that the State recognizes the civil effects of Catholic marriage, and reserves to Catholic tribunals the right to cancel marriages. So (from my reading), no possibility of divorce; because if the Church does not cancel the marriage then the participants are still married in the civil dimension, too.\n\n\n  Art. 36. Italy, considering the teaching of Christian doctrine according to the form received by Catholic tradition as the foundation and the crown of public instruction, agrees that religious instruction imparted in the public elementary schools shall have a further development in the secondary schools according to a programme to be established by an accord between the Holy See and the State.\n\n\nMandatory religious instruction.\n\n\n  Art. 39. The Universities, the greater and lesser Seminaries, diocesan, inter-diocesan or regional, the academies, the colleges and other Catholic Institutes for Ecclesiastical formation and culture shall continue to depend solely from the Holy See without any interference on the part of the scholastic authority of the Kingdom.\n\n\nChurch control of universities.\n\nThe State also reserves some powers for itself (it can protest bishop nominations, bishops must be Italians, etc.)\n\nSo, it seems to be far from being a \"separation\". \n\nI would like to add that it could be argued that any concordat is by definition a breach of the separation of Church and State, since it imposes obligations on each of the parties to the benefit of the other. Of course, not all of the obligations are equally damaging.\n\n\n1Wikipedia says that it was cancelled by mutual agreement in 1984. \n\n2Although with a few special rules.\n",

    "answer": "President Trump was able to do that with ventilators because of the Defense Production Act:\n\n\n  On March 18, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, President Trump issued an executive order that defined ventilators and protective equipment as \"essential to the national defense\", the standard required by the DPA.[17][18] Later that day, he indicated that he would not make immediate use of DPA authority, writing, \"Hopefully there will be no need\"; he indicated that he would do so in a \"worst-case scenario\".[19][20] Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi called upon Trump to \"immediately use the powers of the DPA to mass produce and coordinate distribution of\" critically needed hospital equipment such as ventilators, swabs, and personal protective equipment.[19][20] On March 20, Trump said that he will use the DPA.[21] General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra spoke to Trump administration officials about how GM could support production of ventilators.[22] On March 23, Trump issued an executive order classifying \"health and medical resources necessary to respond to the spread of COVID-19\" as subject to the authority granted by DPA to prohibit hoarding and price gouging.[23][24] Trump's continued reluctance to use the act's authorities prompted further criticism.[25] On March 27, 2020, after negotiations with GM to produce ventilators had broken down over cost, which was being estimated at over $1 billion, but primarily due to GM’s uncertainty as to its ability to provide the number of ventilators required speedily, Trump ordered HHS Secretary Alex Azar to use the authority available under the DPA to require GM to accept and prioritize contracts for the number of ventilators that Azar determines to be appropriate.[26] Trump also named Peter Navarro national policy coordinator for the DPA.[27]\n\n\nFor Trump to do this for toilet paper, he would need to declare it vital to national defense.

I'm not aware of any such metric for South Korea, however, which is why I'm asking.\n\nAlternatively, what else can explain the US poll data?\n",
    "answer_id": "52341",
    "answer": "The key assumption you have made is assuming people in the US act sensibly, and that they would base their answer in the poll on facts. This assumption might not be accurate. A recent (Jan 2019) study shows that facts might not be too important in this matter [1].\n\n\n  Inaccurate views of scientific consensus and the willful rejection of scientific consensus.\n  In a 2014 US survey (15), two-thirds of respondents (67%) thought that scientists did “not have a clear understanding about the health effects of GM crops,” despite broad scientific consensus on the topic (16). Similarly, half of Americans (52%) thought scientists were “divided” in the belief that the universe was created in the Big Bang, and about a third each thought that scientists were divided on anthropogenic climate change (37%) and evolution (29%). Of course, these data do not make clear the cause of these inaccurate views, which, arguably, could stem from people being uninformed, intentionally misinformed, or a bit of both.\n  \n  Furthermore, split-ballot survey experiments have shown that even when Americans do seem to possess accurate knowledge of scientific consensus (however large or small that number may be for a given issue) there is no guarantee that they will integrate that knowledge into their attitudes or policy preferences (17). In other words, these respondents know what the scientific community has established as fact, but they nonetheless refuse to “know” it. Some have therefore argued that rejection of scientifically accurate accounts of the Big Bang or evolution by nonexpert audiences indicates neither a lack of information about scientific consensus nor the presence of misinformation, but, rather, motivated information processing (18). (Highlight mine).\n\n\nGiven that the current US government places little value on facts and that \"Make America Great Again\" was a slogan in the last election, I find it highly plausible that this is a factor here, too - that a certain amount of people simply want to believe that the US is the best in the world in everything, despite facts showing otherwise.\n\nThe study also finds:\n\n\n  When such directional goals influence reasoning processes, individuals are prone to “biased assimilation,” which is characterized by confirmation and disconfirmation bias, or the parallel tendencies to privilege information that is consistent with one’s predispositions and to discredit information that seems contradictory (51). As with selective exposure, motivated reasoning can contribute to an individual becoming misinformed, and it can occur not only in political contexts but also when individuals process information about science and emerging technologies (52–54).\n\n\nIf you want to believe the US is #1 in everything, this seems to be a highly relevant point.\n\nAlso, emotional state can be an important factor. And I think we can agree that the current crisis is a very emotional matter, and that believing the US is doing better than anyone else might be reassuring, even if it isn't based on truth.\n\n\n  The role of emotion.\n  This brings us to discussions of the influence of affect in motivated reasoning processes. There is some evidence that a person’s emotional state can shape the accuracy of his or her beliefs. [...] Notably, individuals’ attraction to emotionally charged content is not limited to politics, and even when it comes to scientific discoveries, individuals are more inclined to spread information that has a greater emotional impact (59).\n\n\n1: Scheufele, Dietram A, and Nicole M Krause. “Science audiences, misinformation, and fake news.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America vol. 116,16 (2019): 7662-7669. doi:10.1073/pnas.1805871115\n\n\n\nSo I think the answer is not that there are any objective metrics that show that the US is handling the crisis better in any way. The fatality rate is magnitudes higher (although it is too early to tell what the toll will be in the end), cases per capita are higher, total cases are higher, et cetera. I don't think there are those metrics that you are looking for. I rather think think it simply shows that a large percentage of the US population is either uninformed or misinformed, for various reasons as outlined above.\n\n\n\nFrom the survey that was linked in the question, we can also see that the opinion on how the US is handling it relative to the rest of the world varies dramatically with the political orientation of the respondent, which would further back up that political orientation plays a significant role in how people perceive facts and responded.\n\n\n\nThe poll data for the question relative to South Korea is roughly in the same boat, polarization-wise. Only about 6% of Republicans say the US is doing worse than South Korea, whereas 45% of Democrats say that:\n\n\n",

I'm not counting staying at home and losing your job, which is an indirect effect and most likely favored as a way of handling the crisis.\n",

    "answer": "Expanding on the answer by Tin Nguyen, the Euro is a a common currency for nations with separate economic policies and separate national debts. Being a member of the Eurozone stops nations from devaluating their currency to compensate for changing economic fundamentals.\n\nBefore and during the 2007 financial crisis bonds from e.g. Greece or Italy had a risk premium compared to German bonds despite the fact that both were government bonds in the same currency. There were even signs that futures traders were driving this premium up by betting against certain governments, or on nations leaving the Eurozone. The famous \"whatever it takes\" speech by Draghi calmed that.\n\nThe financial consequences of the Corona pandemic are not yet known, but it is clear that Italy and Spain will be hit hard. That will increase the risk on a default on national debt which increases the interest which investors demand. Of course that further hinders economic recovery.\n\nIf the Eurozone members jointly guarantee bonds, that lowers the interest payments for the less stable economies and possibly increases the interest for the more stable ones. This might or might not be to the benefit of the EU as a whole and the stronger members individually (since they all benefit from a strong Eurozone), but the more or less clearly voiced suspicion is that Corona is used as an excuse to enact a permanent transfer mechanism.\n",

But hoarding things is part of a broader issue (emphasis mine)\n\n\n  Australia has also suffered from panic buying of toilet paper despite plentiful domestic supply. A risk expert in the country explained it this way: \"Stocking up on toilet paper is … a relatively cheap action, and people like to think that they are 'doing something' when they feel at risk.\"\n  \n  This is an example of \"zero risk bias,\" in which people prefer to try to eliminate one type of possibly superficial risk entirely rather than do something that would reduce their total risk by a greater amount.\n  \n  Hoarding also makes people feel secure. This is especially relevant when the world is faced with a novel disease over which all of us have little or no control. However, we can control things like having enough toilet paper in case we are quarantined.\n\n\nGuns still mean security to a lot of people\n\nGuns are still a powerful way to protect oneself, and more than a few people fear social breakdown, despite the fact that no place in the US has suspended their police force due to the pandemic, nor are there widespread shortages of police. As such, people want weapons to stop intruders\n\n\n  Hyatt said that the type of guns being bought was reflective of the fear prevalent among customers. There was almost no interest in hunting rifles. Instead, people were opting for target guns and there was big demand for AR-15 semi-automatic assault-style rifles.\n  \n  Asked why he thought the spike was happening, Hyatt replied: \"Financial meltdown, pandemic, crime, politics … you throw it all into the pot, and you have one hell of a mess.\"\n\n",

DeBlasio’s is lower, but still quite good at 61-31 approval to disapproval. \n\n\n\nThe above figures are specifically about how well they've done to address the pandemic, but Cuomo’s overall approval has also improved by 54 points to a near record high of 71-23. \n\n\n\nhttps://scri.siena.edu/2020/03/30/87-of-nyers-approve-of-cuomos-handling-of-the-coronavirus/\n\n\n\nThe Hill is also reporting on a national poll conducted by Harvard CAPS/Harris from March 24th - March 26th which shows Cuomo with a national approval rating of 45%, nearly as high as Trump with 48%. Annoyingly, I can't find that actual data anywhere, so we just have to go off the quotes they provide:\n\n\n  Forty-five percent of Americans say they have a favorable view of how New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) is responding to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new Harvard CAPS/Harris poll released exclusively to The Hill.\n  \n  Harvard CAPS/Harris polling director Mark Penn told The Hill. \"No question he is seen now as a leader at least with Democrats and not seen as partisan since he is favorable right now by 2 to 1.\"\n  \n  Cuomo favorability in US hits 45 percent: poll\n\n\nIf we take Penn at is word, that would mean that his approval is 45%, disapproval is ~ 22% and no opinion is 33%. While 45% doesn't sound that high, I'd argue that it's surprising for that many people nationwide to have a positive opinion of a local politician from another state.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "The obvious answer is the General George Washington needed a flag to differentiate his forces from the English forces. It is speculated by historians that the flag was simply created by sewing white stripes on an English Ensign.  The design was simply expedient and similarity to the East India Company is circumstantial.\n\nWhat is difficult to understand this many years removed from the events is the state of the world at the time.  The idea of a federal central government had not been realized at the time or was so new that it was not at the top of everyone's mind include the General. What I mean is every colony has its own flag which was more important to the average man. With so many symbols, picking something to represent the union was almost an after thought.\n\nThe evidence of course is not compelling, but we can speculate by the fact that the so called \"Grand Union Flag\" (So called because it was named that many decades later, it may have been called \"The Continental Color\" by contemporaries) was used to represent both land and sea forces. A practice that was not traditional at the time (There was a country flag, an ensign for ships, a battle flag, a regimental flag, etc.).  Actually there is an analog in modern times. While the flag of the country is the same as that flown on military bases, on ships and used on some military uniforms, there is a flag of sorts on military air forces. For example, the US has a circled star flanked by three strips on each side.  Any way, the continental congress used the flag and then quickly (for the day) discarded it and designed a more permanent design (so that is from around the end of 1775 to June 14 1777).\n",

    "wrong_answer": "Who gets to ask?\n\nIn the Stack Exchange (SE) system, the person asking determines the accepted answer.  That's not a big problem if one person is the clear beneficiary.  But what about systems where multiple people benefit?  Who asks would determine who gets to accept an answer.  \n\nSubject to corruption\n\nThere are regular concerns about people banding together with friends to influence the system in Stack Exchange.  This hardly ever happens.  Why not?  Mostly because the results of being the highest voted or accepted answer don't matter much.  If your answer is accepted over mine, it may bruise my ego, but it doesn't actually matter.  I don't make less money or have to do more work as a result.  \n\nIn your system, the outcome would matter.  As a result, all those worries about people banding together to control the outcome become justified.  Tactical voting would become rampant.  Closing questions so that you can ask your own question and control the acceptance criteria would be useful.  \n\nWho's the dictator?\n\nMany aspects of Stack Exchange are controlled democratically.  But in the end, the Stack Exchange system is a dictatorship, not a democracy.  Stack Exchange can reverse votes (e.g. if you go around down-voting a single person for disagreeing with you) and delete questions and answers (e.g. spam).  \n\nThis works for Stack Exchange for two reasons.  First, they are a relatively benevolent, hands-off dictator.  We rarely feel the tyranny because they are careful about using it.  Second, because Stack Exchange is optional.  If I decide that they are abusing their power, I can start a new site called Queue Swap tomorrow that does the same thing.  If most people agree with me about the abuse of power, I'm likely to get lots of people joining me.  That possibility keeps them honest.  \n\nYour system would not be optional.  So we'd have to have some way of controlling the \"dictator\" in the system.  But in the end, that just gets us back to something mostly like the current system.  An empowered executive who can make the real decisions.  A frustrated minority grumbling under those decisions with which they disagree.  \n\nWho determines urgency?\n\n\n  every important decision is taken based firstly on its ranked urgency\n\n\nWho determines whether a decision is important or urgent?  This isn't unsolvable, but the Stack Exchange system does not generally solve it.  Meta decisions tend to be non-binding, although some people will choose to follow them.  The real decisions about the importance and urgency of changes on Stack Exchange tend to be made by the benevolent dictator.  \n\nWhat happens if the dictator disagrees with you?  For example, Obama finds Zika to be important and finds terrorism to be less important.  \n\nFree markets as Stack Exchange\n\nNote that a free market economy gives many of the same results as you are trying to get from your Stack Exchange system.  Most decisions are made by individuals.  Multiple answers (products) can receive up-votes (purchases).  Your individual decision controls your personal environment, much the way that acceptance controls your question in Stack Exchange.  High reputation (wealthy) users have additional moderation powers.  Yet you don't seem satisfied with this system and want to change it.  \n\nEffecting change\n\nAs you may gather, I don't favor this change.  That said, the question of how to make change is certainly answerable.  You need to find supporters and take control of the mechanism for making changes in your country.  \n\nTo use the United States as an example, this would require either two-thirds of Congress or sufficient support in state legislatures to call a constitutional convention.  If a convention, you'd have to make sure that they voted for your amendment.  Then you need to ratify the amendment with the approval votes of the legislatures in three-quarters of the states (thirty-eight or more).  Note that the last time we had a constitutional convention, we ended up with a new constitution instead of simply amending the old one.  \n\nThis is the age old method for making changes.  It's not fast.  In the US, Republicans as a party were in favor of women's suffrage in 1860 but did not actually pass it until 1920.  \n",

    "question": "In Europe, such comparisons have been published based on data by Google, so I suspect it might available for the US too. E.g.\n\n\n  An analysis here of smartphone location data by the U.S. search engine giant showed that visits to shops, parks or railway stations fell steeply in most European countries between Feb. 16 and March 29 as governments sought to slow the explosive spread of the COVID-19 disease.\n  \n  In Italy and Spain, which have imposed near-total lockdowns on public life, retail and recreational trips were down by 94%. The two Mediterranean countries, along with France, saw the sharpest drops in people passing through transportation hubs like railway or metro stations. Visits to workplaces were down by more than 60% in Italy and Spain, in an indication that their lockdowns may turn out to be the most economically disruptive.\n  \n  To the north, Sweden has by contrast sought to minimise disruption to social and economic life while its caseload remains low. Visits to restaurants, shopping centres and cinemas, for example, have declined by just 24%. Numbers going to grocery markets and pharmacies have fallen by 10%, while trips to the park are actually up by 43% as people head out to enjoy the Scandinavian spring. Going out for a walk or a jog is up in Denmark, Estonia and Finland too.\n  \n  The number of people spending more time in residential areas is up by 5% in Sweden, whereas in Italy and Spain it has increased by 24% and 22% respectively as people are confined to their homes.\n  \n  In Britain, which moved relatively late to restrict people-to-people contacts, the impact has been less severe than in southern Europe. Retail and recreation visits are down by 85%, public transport by 75% and time spent in workplaces by 55%.\n  \n  Germany, which has the third-highest caseload but a relatively low number of fatalities thanks to widespread early testing for COVID-19, has taken a less radical approach with the number of people visiting workplaces down by 39%, the data show.\n\n\nAre there such (comparative) statistics available for US states? E.g. did these numbers fall in NY (which was hardest hit by the pandemic) more than elsewhere in the US?\n",
    "answer_id": "52462",
    "answer": "Yes, Google has published these statistics at a per-state level for the United States. \n\nTo use the example in your question of New York, compared with a state with far fewer COVID-19 cases currently, such as West Virginia, we can see that New York has seen large reductions in mobility trends across every category except Residential, while West Virginia has relatively smaller reductions, and in fact a large increase in mobility trends for parks. \n\nThis seems to be similar across the board, with the statistics for Nebraska, with a similar number of cases as West Virginia also showing smaller reductions in most categories, a smaller increase in Residential mobility trends, and a whopping 109% increase in mobility trends to parks. New Jersey, however, another state which has been fairly badly hit, sees a large reduction in the statistics across the board.\n\nAt a first glance, then, this would seem to support your theory that these numbers fell more significantly within states that have been hardest hit by the pandemic so far, meaning that social distancing measures are being complied with and taken more seriously in these states. Further analysis would need to be performed on the full data set, including the range of social distancing regulations and enforcement levels in the individual states in order to draw full conclusions.\n\nGoogle themselves state in their reports that \"Location accuracy and the understanding of categorized places varies from region to region, so we don’t recommend using this data to compare changes between countries, or between regions with different characteristics (e.g. rural versus urban areas).\"\n",

    "title": "How overcrowded are NY parks? Have they been deemed dangerously so from a public health perspective during this Covid-19 outbreak?",
    "question": "According to a NY Post article, parks in New York have become so overcrowded during this Covid-19 outbreak (supposedly because residents can't find anywhere else to go, e.g. restaurants are closed), so much so that some use cemeteries as parks in the hope of finding a less crowded spot. How accurate are these journalistic impressions? Is there data on the increase in overcrowding in NY parks during this outbreak, and if so, have there been any public health estimates on the danger that these park crowds may cause?\n\n(I see that Cuomo was incensed by the crowded parks, but that was more than a week ago. He did close playgrounds, in the meantime.)\n\nTo those who think this can't be but BS (per comments below), governor Cuomo and mayor de Blasio have disagreed often enough, e.g. The Atlantic relates their disagreement on school closures:\n\n\n  De Blasio angered New York parents and some of his own allies by resisting for days a decision to close schools, acting only following pressure from Cuomo and after a near-revolt by advisers and top public-health officials. “He’s both a bad decision maker and not good at communicating about it,” said an elected New York Democrat and former ally of the mayor’s, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve a working relationship with the de Blasio administration.\n\n\nSo I wouldn't be surprised they disagreed about parks too. The question whether the parks are crowded obviously has a public-health and thus a political dimension too nowadays (so I disagree with those who think this is off topic.)\n\nAnd if you need anther source, the March 23 story was covered by Bloomberg too, with a March 20 image:\n\n\n\n\n  Tired of being cooped up at home, hordes of New Yorkers headed to Central Park and other open spaces in the city over the weekend -- and that’s making Governor Andrew Cuomo very irritated.\n  \n  “It’s insensitive, it’s arrogant, it’s self-destructive, it’s disrespectful to other people, and it has to stop, and it has to stop now,” he said. “This is not a joke, and I am not kidding.”\n  \n  Calling the crowds “wholly inappropriate” amid a statewide stay-home order, he’s now asking the city to develop a plan that he can approve Monday to correct that.\n  \n  “We talk about social distancing,” he said. “I was in these parks, and you would not know that anything was going on.”\n\n\nI don't know how [un]reliable \"The Gothamist\" is, but they posted these images supposedly from March 27:\n\n\n\n\nOf course, a lot can change in a couple of weeks in people's attitudes, even if the parks are still open. And likewise some photos may be unrepresentative. The question is: did any behavioral change happen that made the closures unnecessary, or was Cuomo ranting like a madman and there was no problem to begin with? \n",

    "title": "Are any countries besides China planning to use \"Fangcang\" hospitals to relocate those infected/suspected of Covid-19, but who have a mild illness?",
    "question": "Somewhat controversially, China has had temporarily relocated those infected with Covid-19 in the Wuhan area to so-called Fangcang hospitals, large communal areas transformed into make-shift hospitals. Although there were up to 13 Fangcang hospitals opened at one point in Wuhan, these were apparently all closed by March 10.\n\n\n  Fangcang shelter hospitals may seem similar to the makeshift and emergency field hospitals used during previous epidemics in other countries, for example, in the USA during the 1918–19 influenza pandemic, or in African countries during the 2014–15 Ebola epidemic. However, they differ in several important ways. First, the Fangcang shelter hospitals in China were established to isolate the patients who were most likely to transmit the infection because they had only mild to moderate COVID-19 and were thus likely to be active in their daily lives and in contact with family and community members. Second, the Fangcang shelter hospitals served an important triage function, separating patients by severity of symptoms, which was not a focus of previous makeshift and emergency field hospitals. [...]\n\n\nThese Fangcang hospitals should not be confused with the other kind of emergency hospitals that China had built earlier, for those more seriously sick with Covid-19, such as the Huoshenshan Hospital. (The latter was a prefab hospital with separate rooms.)\n\nI've heard that some countries are already considering converting open-space structures to some kind of emergency/extra hospitals, e.g. as seen in this US footage. While the open-space conversion resembles more a Fangcang than the other type of prefab Chinese hospital, what do know about plans to mass-quarantine the mild cases in such open-space-conversion hospitals elsewhere, i.e. do (any of) these resemble Fangcangs in (intended) function, not just in looks?\n",

    "answer": "Yes, several countries are planning to implement this approach, and in some cases, already have. On March 12th, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), an EU agency, updated its rapid risk assessment on the COVID-19 pandemic, in which it advises states to \n\n\n  designate treatment facilities both for mild and for severe COVID-19 cases with critical care capabilities (e.g. ECMO). This\n  implies activation of hospital plans to the highest level to be able to cancel elective diagnostic and operative procedures and\n  re-assign human resources, creating temporary treatment facilities for the mild cases or advising self-isolation until\n  symptoms improve or worsen.\n\n\nThe WHO also released guidance to this effect on March 17th, reiterating that \n\n\n  WHO recommends that all laboratory confirmed cases be isolated and\n  cared for in a health care facility.\n  \n  [...]\n  \n  If all mild cases cannot be isolated in health facilities, then those\n  with mild illness and no risk factors may need to be isolated in\n  non-traditional facilities, such as repurposed hotels, stadiums or\n  gymnasiums where they can remain until their symptoms resolve and\n  laboratory tests for COVID-19 virus are negative.\n\n\nIn Madrid, this advice was implemented with a temporary hospital set up in the IFEMA conference centre. The first patients arrived at the facility on March 21st, and initially had a capacity for 200 patients with 'mild' cases of COVID-19. Capacity will eventually be extended to 1300 beds, with a small number of ICU units in case these mild cases progress to severe cases.\n\nHotel Vía Castellana has also been converted (article in Spanish) to a temporary hospital for mild cases, with six of the hospital's floors converted to facilities for the lightly ill, and a seventh converted to house medical staff.\n\nIn South Korea, this strategy has also been used - the WSJ reports that in order to solve the issue of hospital overcrowding:\n\n\n  South Korea divided confirmed patients into four categories. Only the\n  sickest and elderly went to hospitals. The young and asymptomatic went\n  to dormitories, which were lent by Samsung Life Insurance Co., LG\n  Display Co. and others, equipped with little more than beds, Wi-Fi and\n  the occasional television.\n  \n  The decision ensured that low-risk individuals remained quarantined\n  under government watch. Thousands of South Korea’s virus patients have\n  ridden out the past several weeks living in buildings where companies\n  typically put up workers for off-site, multiday training.\n\n\nIn the Phillipines, \"Emergency Quarantine Facilities\" (EQFs) are being planned, temporary centres designed for \"patients who are waiting for test results or have mild symptoms but aren’t in dire straits — a way to keep potentially infected people separate from their communities.\"\n\nMany countries, however, have chosen not to adopt this strategy, instead advising those with mild to moderate symptoms to self-isolate, prioritising hospital beds, including field hospital beds, for those most at risk or with the worst symptoms. In Singapore, the country had enough hospital capacity to deal with all patients, including those with mild symptoms, due in part to the amount of testing and contact tracing which was used to isolate and quarantine cases.\n",

Teachers union cronies, however, are not supporting oligarchs because there are a large number of teachers in society. Other large groups often labeled cronies of politicians include realators , sailors, bureaucrats, and farmers. All of these groups benefit from government action, but none are concentrated or powerful enough to be considered oligarchs. \n",

    "question": "After last minute, party-line decisions by the US and Wisconsin Supreme Courts, Wisconsin will hold their presidential primary and a hotly-contested Supreme Court election tomorrow (April 7th) despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The state's Democratic governor has been pushing to delay the election and/or extend the window for absentee ballot collection, but the Republican controlled legislature have opposed both moves. \n\nIn addition to the the potential for voters to get infected while voting, the vast majority of polling sites have been closed due to a lack of volunteers (most of whom are usually retirees) to run them:\n\n\n  The state has faced serious questions about its ability to run an election amid the pandemic.

    "answer": "Rural voters aren't afraid to go to the polls to keep a conservative state supreme court justice in power.\n\nThe April 2020 ballot does include the U.S. presidential primary, but that will have little effect on state politics.  After I first posted this answer, the New York Times echoed many of the points I make below, starting with:\n\n\n  Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders are on the ballot in Wisconsin, but the main event is the State Supreme Court race between the conservative incumbent justice, Daniel Kelly, and a liberal challenger, Jill Karofsky.\n\n\nWisconsin has an elected state supreme court that currently has 5 conservatives and 2 liberals.  One of the conservatives (Daniel Kelly) is up for election in April 2020, and the another conservative is up in the next election after that (Pat Rogensack, 2023).  If liberals win both of those seats back, they would have a 4-3 majority and could undo the laws that keep the minority Republican party in power.\n\n\n  The election determined the size of the court's conservative majority. A win for Karofsky would have reduced the conservative majority to 4-3, meaning that the next regularly scheduled election in 2023 would decide control of the court. A Kelly win would have preserved the court's 5-2 conservative majority.\n  \n  Ballotpedia\n\n\nIt's helpful to understand the political context:\n\n\nFor decades prior to 2010, Wisconsin was a moderate state.  The legislature and governorship each frequently flipped between the Democratic and Republican parties.  Since 1900, Wisconsin has equally chosen Republicans and Democrats for President.\nJustices on the state supreme court are elected and technically nonpartisan.  Nonetheless, their conservative versus liberal ideology are often clear.  For decades prior to 2010, the state supreme court held a liberal majority.\nIt's worth mentioning that long ago, Wisconsin Republicans were leaders in open elections and progressive ideas.  The Republican party started in Wisconsin, as an anti-slavery party (later to be re-started in Michigan).  The word \"progressive\" was coined by Republican Robert La Follette.  Wisconsin was the first or among the first states to adopt women's suffrage, open ballots, primary elections, recall elections, referenda, outlawing child labor, worker's compensation, and income taxes; all were progressive Republican measures.  Prior to the Tea Party, the state was considered one of the most bipartisan and least corrupt states.\nLed primarily by Tea Party candidates, in the fall 2010 election, Wisconsin Republicans won control of all three branches of government.  This included the election of Scott Walker as governor, a one-seat majority in the state senate, a considerable margin in the state assembly, and a 4 to 3 majority in the state supreme court.\nRepublicans quickly enacted a series of laws that would lock in their party's control:\n\n\nUsing sophisticated computer models to draw election maps for the U.S. House, state senate, and state assembly to maximize Republican seats and to pack Democratic votes into few districts.  The gerrymandering is so successful that in the 2018 elections, Republicans won 5 of 8 U.S. House seats with only 45.61% of votes, and 63 of 99 state assembly seats with only 44.75% of votes.\nAdopting a voter-ID law.  Minorities and the poor -- who tend to vote for Democrats -- are less likely to have the proper types of identification.\nPurged 234,000 voters from voting rolls.\nRequiring early voting to be performed only at the municipal clerk's office, and not multiple sites.  Thus the 600,000 residents of Milwaukee (a Democratic stronghold) had only one site for early voting, the same as a town of 600 people would.  This law was struck down by a federal judge in 2016.\n\n\n  \n  A requirement that cities can have only one place for early voting. Critics have said large cities such as Milwaukee should be able to have multiple voting sites because not everyone can get downtown easily.\n  \n\nLimiting the days and hours for early and absentee voting.\nReplacing the agency which oversees elections, from the Government Accountability Board composed of judges chosen by other judges, to the Wisconsin Election Commission chosen by politicians.\nMoving the state supreme court elections from the fall (which have high Democratic turnout) to the spring (which have poor Democratic turnout).  This has been particularly effective at increasing the conservative control of the court, from 3-4 in 2010 to 7-2 in 2020.  Note how the election during the pandemic is a spring election, with a supreme court contest.\nHolding special elections to fill vacancies on unusual dates -- when Republicans turn out -- instead of the usual fall and spring election dates when Democrats turn out.\nAfter a series of failed recall elections for the governor and Republicans in the state senate, changes that made recalls more difficult (2015 Act 117).\nA series of laws (most famously 2011 Act 10) to cripple the power and finances of labor unions, which are the primary backers of Democratic candidates.\nIn 2015, changing the Chief Justice position from the most senior justice (a liberal) to being chosen by a majority of the court (conservatives).\nIn 2015, stripping the powers of the Democratic secretary of state.\nIncreasing the powers of the Republican governor and attorney general.  When Democrats won back these offices in 2018, the powers of those offices were reduced in a lame duck session.\n\nThe conservatives controlling the state supreme court have upheld most of the laws described above.  This includes laws that affected the justices' own re-election.  In particular, the decision specifically about whether to continue the election during the pandemic went along ideological lines.\nModerate Republicans were treated poorly by the dominant Tea Party faction.  The previous Republican leaders of the legislature -- Dave Schultz in the assembly and Mike Ellis in the senate -- were pushed out of leadership by Tea Party leaders.  Schultz would later testify in a gerrymandering case that Republicans were brought one-by-one to a law office, and were ordered to vote for the gerrymandered maps, else their own districts would be gerrymandered to make them lose.  In the ensuing years, many moderate Republicans quit the party in disgust, and many moderate office-holders were voted out in primaries by Tea Party candidates.  The loss of moderates had drained the support of the Republican party.\nSince 2010, Democrats have been gaining ground.  By number of voters statewide, the Republican party is actually a minority party in Wisconsin.  Wisconsin's top Republican even admitted that they aren't the majority:\n\n\n  After the Republican Robin Vos, the speaker of the Wisconsin Statehouse, said that “if you took Madison and Milwaukee out of the state election formula, we would have a clear majority.\"\n\n\nHowever, the measures described above are so effective that the state supreme court and both houses of the state legislature still remain in Republican control.\nDemocrats swept every statewide office in 2018: U.S. Senate, governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, and treasurer.  They had more votes in the U.S. House, but because of gerrymandering, they won only 3 of 8 seats.  They also had more votes in the state assembly and gained one seat, but again because of gerrymandering, they did not gain control.\nAs has happened nationwide, the Wisconsin Republican party has aligned with rural interests and and the Democratic party with urban interests.  COVID-19 is likely to keep people in high-density (i.e. Democratic) districts at home.  Like other rural places in the U.S., rural Wisconsinites believe that COVID-19 is a \"big city\" phenomenon and are likely to show up to the polls.  Per the New York Times, about one of the least populous counties:\n\n\n  Bruce Johnson, the Democratic chairman in Pepin County, along the state’s western border with Minnesota, said he pushed for absentee balloting but people were less concerned because they rarely wait in lines to vote.\n\n\nWikipedia:\n\n\n  When the election went ahead on 7 April, access to easy in-person voting heavily depended on where voters were located. In smaller or more rural communities, which tend to be whiter and vote Republican, few issues were reported.\n\n\nIt's therefore in the interest of Republicans to keep the election going during the pandemic.\nShould liberals take back the state supreme court, they can overturn the system of laws which keeps the Republican party in power.  They would then be at the mercy of the voters, who have been increasingly voting Democratic.\n\n",

    "title": "What political and social factors underlie Sweden's controversial response to COVID-19?",
    "question": "Sweden has adopted a far less radical set of policies in reaction to COVID-19 than most other European states. Many other European states are in \"lock-down\", with severe restrictions on people's free movement, with people being advised to only leave their homes for food/medicine. In Sweden, by contrast, people are largely carrying on with their normal lives.\n\n\n  While every other country in Europe has been ordered into ever more stringent coronavirus lockdown, Sweden has remained the exception. Schools for pupils up to 16 years, kindergartens, bars, restaurants, ski resorts, sports clubs, hairdressers: all remain open, weeks after everything closed down in next door Denmark and Norway.\n  \n  As the rest of Europe lives under lockdown, Sweden keeps calm and carries on - The Guardian, March 28, 2020\n\n\nWhat social and political factors underlie this decision, and why is it so dramatically different to other European countries response?\n",
    "answer_id": "52555",
    "answer": "The reason for Sweden's rather hands-off approach compared to other European countries was summed up rather well by lead epidemiologist of the Public Health Agency of Sweden, Anders Tegnell, who said in an interview with CNBC:\n\n\n  My view is that basically all European countries are trying to do the\n  same thing — we’re trying to slow down the spread as much as possible\n  to keep healthcare and society working ... and we have shown some\n  different methods to slow down the spread, [...] Sweden has gone\n  mostly for voluntary measures because that’s how we’re used to\n  working, and we have a long tradition that it works rather well.\n\n\nThis tradition of 'laissez-faire-ism' that Tegnell talks about was explored by Johan Norberg in his 2013 essay How Laissez-Faire Made Sweden Rich. This is quite long but well worth a read. Notably, Norberg argues that rather than Sweden's economic and social successes being a result of the SAP \"managing to tax, spend, and regulate Sweden into a more equitable distribution of wealth—without hurting its productive capacity\", Sweden's greatest successes both economically and socially \"took place when Sweden had a laissez-faire economy\".\n\nSweden's approach to the current pandemic, then, would seem to be influenced by the political traditions of its past. I should note that although Tegnell is hopeful that the current strategy will be successful, he doesn't rule out the implementation of more stringent measures should the data suggest that the laissez-faire tactics are not working.\n\nAs far as social factors that have influenced Sweden's response go, one such factor is how sparsely spread its population is. This article from Our World in Data notes how Sweden consistently ranks near the top of metrics related to single-occupant households, and the country also ranks 50th out of 54th for Population Density amongst other European countries.\n\nIt is likely that another factor has been the reluctance of the government to negatively affect the economy more than is required. For example, although taking a hands-off approach with regard to restricting personal liberties, it has taken a far more active role in ensuring the continued functioning of business, and on March 27th announced that it will guarantee 70% of bank loans provided to companies that are experiencing financial difficulty as a result of the pandemic.\n\nIn conclusion, Sweden's response so far seems to be a combination of the reluctance of Swedes to accept restrictions on personal liberty - note the outcry by opposition parties when a proposal to rule by decree was announced, a tradition of past laissez-faire approaches, and distinct social factors that will potentially help provide a natural defence against the virus.\n",

Note that despite the Senate seemingly being able to dictate the content of the bill, the House still has to approve the amendment.\n\nThe Senate has decided that it is legitimate to fulfil the letter of this clause, if arguably not the spirit, by replacing the entire text of a bill originating in the House with a bill for raising revenue. The constitutionality of this decision has been examined by Rebecca M. Kysar in her 2013 paper The 'Shell Bill' Game: Avoidance and The Origination Clause. In Chapter II, subsection C2, she notes that while the Supreme Court has never ruled on this, several state courts and lower federal courts have condoned this interpretation.\n\nThe original bill is now one and the same as the CARES Act, and you are correct in saying that it can no longer fill its original purpose, as the original wording has been completely removed and replaced by the Senate amendment.\n",

It was only Tuesday when CanSino said it had filed the pre-IND review application for the vaccine to authorities and was in the process of a rolling submission of technical documents.

But the timing of the Chinese announcement was roughly two days later after the US announced the first Moderna vaccine dose having been injected into a human (on March 16). Interestingly perhaps, China is also developing a mRNA vaccine \"jointly developed by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Tongji University and Stermina in Shanghai\", but this one is still undergoing animal testing in China, with human testing announced to begin mid-April.\n\nSo yeah, the US (NIAID/Moderna) and China (CanSino) are now basically in a \"race for the [vaccine] cure\".

(The EU has given Curevac a grant to work on a mRNA vaccine similar to the Moderna one; however no human tests have begun with that--they've been announced for June. The WHO said that over 40 concrete vaccine candidates have been proposed, with at least a hundred in development.)\n\nThe WSJ reported (without a lot of specifics on the regulatory side that):\n\n\n  Counting drugs approved for other diseases, there are 254 clinical trials testing treatments or vaccines for the virus, many spearheaded by universities and government research agencies, with hundreds more trials planned. Researchers have squeezed timelines that usually total months into weeks or even days.\n\n",

    "title": "What did the US CDC say about COVID-19 human-to-human transmission between Jan 14 and 21?",
    "question": "From (answers to) a related question, the WHO had mostly changed their public stance on the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 after Jan 22, while giving mostly \"negative signals\" on this matter of human-to-human transmission before Jan 22.\n\nInterestingly, on Jan 17, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) put out a rapid report saying that: \n\n\n  The occurrence of a few cases having no history of contact with the implicated market\n  or other any similar market suggests the possibility of the infection source being more widely distributed, or of human-to-human transmission similar to other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The occurrence of a few family clusters also supports this latter hypothesis. However, there is currently no knowledge on the transmission mode or risk factors for transmission. Furthermore, there is no information on the disease spectrum or risk factors for severity. In light of these unknowns, we cannot exclude the possibility of low-level virus circulation in the Wuhan community and thus the possibility of other clusters occurring in the near future. [...]\n  \n  \n  There is a high likelihood of case importation in countries with the greatest volume of people travelling to and from Wuhan (i.e. countries in Asia).\n  There is a low likelihood of importation of cases in EU/EEA countries, due to the less extensive traffic of people with Wuhan. \n  \n\n\nFor comparison, what did the US CDC say on this matter (human-to-human transmission) within this period (i.e between Jan 14 and 21), and did they also asses back then (like the ECDC did) the likelihood of importation into the US?\n\n\n\nInsofar I was able to find, by Jan 31, the US CDC was clearly convinced of human-to-human transmission:\n\n\n  On January 31, 2020, CDC published updated PUI guidance (8) in response to the evolving global epidemiology of 2019-nCoV, including the rapid geographic expansion and documentation of person-to-person transmission (9). Updated guidance emphasizes 2019-nCoV testing for symptomatic persons in close contact with patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, persons returning from Hubei province in addition to Wuhan City, and persons from mainland China requiring hospitalization because of fever and lower respiratory tract illness. Additional refinements to this approach likely will be needed in the future as understanding of 2019-nCoV epidemiology continues to improve.\n\n\nBut what did they say roughly two weeks earlier, before the WHO had confirmed human-to-human transmission?\n",
    "answer_id": "52613",
    "answer": "On January 17th, the CDC announced that COVID-19 screening would begin at \"three U.S. airports that receive most of the travelers from Wuhan, China: San Francisco (SFO), New York (JFK), and Los Angeles (LAX) airports.\"\n\nThey also state in this press release that:\n\n\n  CDC is actively monitoring this situation for pertinent information\n  about the source of outbreak, and risk for further spread through\n  person-to-person or animal-to-person transmission. CDC may adjust\n  screening procedures and other response activities as this outbreak\n  investigation continues and more is learned about the newly emerging\n  virus. Entry screening alone is not a guarantee against the possible\n  importation of this new virus but is an important public health tool\n  during periods of uncertainty and part of a multilayered government\n  response strategy. As new information emerges, CDC will reassess entry\n  screening measures and could scale activities up or down accordingly.\n\n\nThis indicates that an assessment of the likelihood of importation of the virus into the US was completed, and a decision was made that only the airports with the largest amount of traffic needed to be screened. They do however note that this is not a guarantee that the virus will not be imported. Further on in the briefing, they mention that:\n\n\n  China health officials report that most of the patients infected with\n  2019-nCoV have had exposure to a large market where live animals were\n  present, suggesting this is a novel virus that has jumped the species\n  barrier to infect people. Chinese authorities additionally report that\n  several hundred health care workers caring for outbreak patients are\n  being monitored and no spread of this virus from patients to health\n  care workers has been seen. They report no sustained spread of this\n  virus in the community, however there are indications that some\n  limited person-to-person spread may have occurred. CDC is responding\n  to this outbreak out of an abundance of caution, ready to detect\n  people infected with 2019-CoV.\n\n\nThis briefing suggests that while the CDC was preparing for human-to-human transmission to be confirmed, and may have even thought that this was likely, it did not have the data to confirm this.\n\nLater on, on the 21st, the CDC released another briefing after the first COVID-19 positive patient was identified in the US. The briefing notes that the patient returned from China on the 15th, before the screening mentioned above was implemented. This release, however also does not state that human-to-human transmission is confirmed, but mentions that\n\n\n  While originally thought to be spreading from animal-to-person, there\n  are growing indications that limited person-to-person spread is\n  happening. It’s unclear how easily this virus is spreading between\n  people.\n\n\nAt this point the CDC also implemented screening at two more airports, Atlanta and Chicago.\n\nIt seems clear, therefore, that the CDC did not have access to data which confirmed human-to-human transmission, although the steps taken to implement health screening at airports, and the advice given to healthcare providers on January 8th indicates that it certainly thought that the likelihood of this was great. Clearly the health screening also proves that spread from Wuhan was seen as a possibility, although we can infer from the fact that this was initially only set up at three airports that this was either not seen as a large possibility, or that the spread via air-travel was not expected to be high enough to warrant a complete lock-down.\n",

    "question": "Even Donald Trump has praised India on providing the drug Hydroxychloroquine. How has India become the primary source for the drug? \n",
    "answer_id": "52617",
    "answer": "India is a large producer of Hydroxychloroquine because, prior to the promotion of the drug as a potential treatment for COVID-19, its most widespread use was as an anti-malarial drug. India has, according to the WHO's World malaria report 2019, the largest proportion of malaria cases outside of Africa:\n\n\n  Nineteen countries in sub-Saharan Africa and India carried almost\n  85% of the global malaria burden.\n\n\nThe report also notes that India is the only one of the \"high burden to high impact\" countries (basically countries most affected by malaria) to have significant domestic investment into dealing with the disease compared to the reliance on international aid. This has manifested itself in the form of pharmaceutical manufacturers which can supply India with its domestic demand for the drug, such as Zydus Cadila and Ipca Laboratories.\n\nThis Forbes article notes that these companies in particular have significant capacity to ramp up production:\n\n\n  “The priority is to manufacture this drug versus anything else,” says\n  Sharvil Patel, managing director at Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila,\n  which had $1.9 billion in revenues in fiscal 2019. “We have ramped up\n  our production of hydroxychloroquine from 3 metric tons per month to\n  20 to 30 metric tons per month and can scale it up further to 40 to 50\n  metric tons if there is a requirement.”\n  \n  Ipca Labs, which has 20-metric-ton capacity, can produce 100 million\n  tablets a month. “The Indian government has placed a significant\n  order,” says Ajit Kumar Jain, joint managing director of Ipca Labs.\n  “We can increase our manufacturing capacity to 26 metric tons in a\n  month or two. We are also simultaneously ramping up our packing and\n  labelling lines.”\n  \n  [...]\n  \n  Sudarshan Jain, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical\n  Alliance, an industry group, says that “the domestic demand is 3\n  million tablets a month but we have the capacity to go up to 150\n  million to 200 million tablets a month easily.” He adds that “it is\n  very difficult to predict demand going forward because we do not know\n  how many will be affected.”\n\n\nThis is, of course, on top of the underlying fact that India is, according to Raconteur, the largest provider of generic drugs globally, with its pharmaceutical industry is growing by 7 to 8 per cent a year, with growth of 11 to 13 percent expected in 2020.\n\nIt seems that India's prominence in the manufacture of the drug is due to existing infrastructure due to high existing domestic demand, and a strong underlying pharmaceutical industry, giving it the ability to quickly scale up production levels.\n",

I would rather say quietist, political activists (rather recent if you exclude holy war partisans), and holy war partisans.\n\nSalafism is quite well summed up in the wikipedia page :\n\n\n  The Salafi movement or Salafist movement or Salafism is an ultra-conservative reform branch or movement within Sunni Islam that developed in Arabia in the first half of the 18th century against a background of European colonialism. It advocated a return to the traditions of the \"devout ancestors\" (the salaf).\n\n\nSo far, it means you dress, pray, eat, live, ... according to the sacred sunni texts (quran &amp; sunni hadith), with the salafs as role models. \n\nHowever, these salafs wanted to establish an islamic state, and even fought wars for it. What to do about it ? What to do about the current government, assuming you already have freedom of religion * ?\n\nFirst option: don't care. This is what salafi quietism means. This movements considers that mere mortals would be unable to establish an islamic state, so they shouldn't try to do it. It can also mean to wait for the mahdi, the person in charge of establishing an islamic state before the final judgement (who may be a \"reincarnation\" of the prophet, I am not sure about that, I confess that religion uses words without enough clarity behind them for me).\n\nSecond option: care. It can mean to engage in politics, like what some salafists did after the egyptian relovution. They got engaged in politics separately from the already in place islamist parties. In Tunisia, some founded the party Jahbat al islah. Or, it can also mean wage a holy war, what is usually called \"jihadi salafism\".\n\nNote that there is an ambiguity with the term \"jihad\", since some people are calling to reform its meaning. There is none with the term \"holy war\" or with the activities of the list of groups mentioned in the wikipedia article for \"salafi jihadi\".\n\nAs for \"who are they\" like in a list of names and their locations, I think a lot of governments would like to know this...\n\n*This can be problematic to define depending on what the religion is asking for. \n",

    "answer_id": "52626",
    "answer": "Broadly speaking, the Fed can only keep markets liquid by doing things like buying assets or making loans to banks against assets owned by the banks.  That's awesome if you're worried that mortgage-backed securities are tanking in value and the Fed can come along and prop up their value until the panic is over.  That's a concern today but it was a much bigger concern back in 2008 when the housing bubble burst. \n It is useless if your goal is to get money into the hands of people or small businesses that need it to pay rent or pay their mortgages today.  If Congress wants to get money to those folks, it has to pass legislation to spend the money.\n\nFed spending is also very different from Congressional spending because the Fed is generally buying (or lending against) assets, it's not generating spending that drives demand.  Most of the Fed's $1.5 T involves going to banks that have some assets and saying \"Hey, nice assets.  We'd love to give you a cheap loan if you put those assets up as collateral.\"  That ensures that banks have plenty of money on hand to be able to lend out and ensures that there is a willing buyer for whatever assets the Fed is lending against.  Eventually, though, banks are going to give the Fed back that $1.5 T with a small bit of interest.  \n",

There is also a large academic community of public health specialists that study problems like this.

We argue that\n  the benefits of quarantine and isolation justify some level of\n  coercion or compulsion by the state, but that the state should be able\n  to provide the strongest justification possible for implementing such\n  measures.\n\n\nThe Challenge Of Mandatory Evacuation: Providing For And Deciding For\n\n\n  Insufficient attention has been given to the ethical and legal\n  questions surrounding mandatory evacuation in disasters and\n  emergencies. We argue that mandatory evacuation orders entail a\n  governmental duty both to provide for people and to decide for people:\n  Government must trigger the provision of critical resources as well as\n  vigorous and persistent efforts to persuade reluctant citizens to\n  leave.\n\n\nOf course the political powers might choose to not to follow the advice of their professional staff or outside professionals, but that comes with grave political risks if the situation goes south.

The governments of Louisiana and New Orleans we broadly criticized for not fully evacuating the city. Later in 2005 Hurricane Rita was projected to hit Houston and a mandatory evacuation was ordered. Dozens of people died in the evacuation of Houston, from heat stroke, accidents, and a tragic bus fire. As it turned out, Hurricane Rita struck Houston only a passing blow, and fewer people died in the storm than in the evacuation. New lesson learned: don't evacuate, shelter in place, evacuate only those most at risk. Then in 2017 Hurricane Harvey hit Houston, causing massive flooding, and requiring the rescue of thousands of people trapped in floodwaters. And afterwards everyone was asking Why Didn't Houston Evacuate?.\n\nPredicting the future is hard.\n",

Elections were also not canceled during the Civil War, or as a result of the War of 1812 (during which the U.S. capitol was burned to the ground by foreign military forces).\n\nFor example, elections were not prevented from being conducted by the Spanish flu of 1918 which was in all respects deadlier and more contagious than the coronavirus, despite the fact that the technology available for a response in 1918 was less advanced.\n\nRealistically, you would need a disease that is catastrophic on the scale of the Black Plague in medieval Europe (that killed a third to a half of the population in many places), and not merely something like the coronavirus (with a 2% mortality rate), to take out the electoral process in the U.S.\n\nA situation like that would involve the collapse of the entire regime and government, and would send us into uncharted waters.\n\nSecond, election laws can be changed quite quickly in an emergency. One could, for example, shift as Colorado has, to a system of near complete all mail in ballots, to reduce the amount of in person interactions that were needed.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution does not provide the option of not conducting an election. In the absence of an election, elected offices become vacant and the succession provisions of the law which usually kick in when there is a death during someone's term of office would kick in. U.S. Senate vacancies can be filled in most states by Governors on a temporary basis. U.S. House seats that go vacant must be filled in vacancy elections. There is a line of succession to the Presidency defined by law involving a few key Congressional leaders and the cabinet.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "According to this article How to mislead with statistics, DHS Secretary Nielsen edition reported on June 18, 2018\n\n\n  “The kids are being used as pawns by the smugglers and the\n  traffickers,” Nielsen said.\n  \n  “Again, let’s just pause to think about this statistic: 314 percent\n  increase in adults showing up with kids that are not a family unit,”\n  she said. “Those are traffickers, those are smugglers, that is MS-13,\n  those are criminals, those are abusers.”\n  \n  A DHS representative provided The Washington Post with the hard\n  numbers behind Nielsen’s statistic. There were 46 cases of fraud —\n  “individuals using minors to pose as fake family units” — in fiscal\n  2017, the period from October 2016 through September 2017. In the\n  first five months of 2018, there were 191 cases.\n  \n  That is an increase of 315 percent.\n\n\nIt is not immediately clear what the numbers are specifically related to human trafficking arrests, see U.S. Border Patrol Southwest Border Apprehensions by Sector FY2018 for the raw data. According to statistics for 2016 at Human Trafficking - ICE \n\n\n  In fiscal year 2016, HSI initiated 1,029 investigations with a nexus\n  to human trafficking and recorded 1,952 arrests, 1,176 indictments,\n  and 631 convictions; 435 victims were identified and assisted.\n\n\nand Border arrests exceed 50,000 for third month in a row.\n\nThe most recent Bureau of Justice Statistics data as to human trafficking is for 2015 Federal Prosecution of Human-Trafcking Cases, 2015, where the total number was reported to be 1,923 total persons referred for human trafficking prosecution\n\n\n  In fscal year 2015, 1,923 suspects were referred to U.S. attorneys\n  with human trafcking as the lead charge—39% for peonage, slavery,\n  forced labor or sex trafcking; 32% for production of child\n  pornography; and 29% for transportation for illegal sex activity. This\n  was a 41% increase from the 1,360 suspects referred to U.S. attorneys\n  in 2011.\n\n\nIt is important to note the conflicting reports that have been issued as to the subject matter of human trafficking, see 2018 NCVRW Resource Guide: Human Trafficking Fact Sheet\n\n\n  In FY 2016, DOJ initiated 241 federal human trafficking prosecutions\n  and charged 531 defendants. Of these prosecutions, nearly 95% were\n  predominantly related to sex trafficking. DOJ also secured convictions\n  against 439 traffickers in FY 2016. Of those convicted, 97% were\n  primarily involved in sex trafficking.\n\n\nand the disclaimer of the data held within the report\n\n\n  Human trafficking is difficult to measure. Fear of harm to self or\n  others, language barriers, lack of personal freedom, and fear of law\n  enforcement often prevent victims from reporting their victimization\n  or seeking services. Additionally, multiple agencies are charged with\n  investigating and prosecuting human trafficking cases, at both the\n  federal and state level, and providing services to victims. The\n  record-keeping systems across these agencies may not allow for\n  cross-referencing, and some victims may appear in the records of\n  multiple agencies. Because of this, human trafficking reports should\n  not be used to make generalizations about the scale or scope of human\n  trafficking in the United States.\n\n\nwhere \"human trafficking\" can be divided into at least several categories including \"labor trafficking\" and \"sex trafficking\". \n\nIt is not clear if the question attempts to distinguish between sex trafficking, labor trafficking, or human trafficking without any forced attached sex or labor after the \"victim\" or \"illegal immigrant\", depending on the perspective is successfully trafficked into the United States; for example, a family paying a trafficker to get them to the U.S. without being forced into sex or labor, or if the premise is that all human trafficking involves forced sex and labor.\n\nWhat is clear is that the total prosecutions for human trafficking arrests at the border is a substantially low percentage of the total \"border arrests\".\n\nAccording to Southwest Border Migration FY2018 a total of 145393 persons have been apprehended between April 2018 and June 2018. Correlating the total number of individuals charged with human trafficking for the entire year of 2018 to the publication date of the Washington Post article How to mislead with statistics, DHS Secretary Nielsen edition, we have 191.\n\nThus, the math is \n\n(191 / 145393) * 100 = 0.13136808512101683\n\nor, 0.1%.\n",

Initially:\n\n\n  Having received a number of complaints regarding antisemitism in the\n  Labour Party, we believe the Labour Party may have unlawfully\n  discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious\n  beliefs.\n  \n  Our concerns are sufficient for us to consider using our statutory\n  enforcement powers. As set out in our enforcement policy, we are now\n  engaging with the Labour Party to give them an opportunity to respond\n\n\nThen:\n\n\n  We contacted The Labour Party after receiving a number of complaints\n  about allegations of antisemitism in the party.\n  \n  We have carefully considered the response we have received from the\n  Party and have opened a formal investigation.\n  \n  We are using our powers under the Equality Act to open an\n  investigation, which will look at:\n  \n  \n  whether unlawful acts have been committed by the Party or its employees or agents\n  the steps taken by the Party to implement the recommendations made in the reports on antisemitism by Baroness Royall, the Home Affairs\n  Select Committee and in the Chakrabarti Report\n  whether the Rule Book and the Party’s investigatory and disciplinary processes have enabled or could enable it to deal\n  efficiently and effectively with complaints of race or religion or\n  belief discrimination and racial harassment or victimisation,\n  including whether appropriate sanctions have been or could be applied\n  whether the Party has responded to complaints of unlawful acts in a lawful, efficient and effective manner\n  \n\n\nLabour is the first political party to be the subject of a formal EHRC investigation into institutional racism since the inquiry into the neo-Nazi British National Party (probably rather fewer surprises in that report). \n\nThe Labour Against Anti-Semitism group claims to have submitted 15,000 pages of evidence that more than a thousand Labour members are anti-semitic and that the party has failed to take proper action. \n\nIn an article for the Times titled, \"The way in which the leadership of the Labour Party has dealt with anti-Jewish racism is incompatible with the British values of which we are so proud\", The Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, has also weighed in. No Chief Rabbi has commented on a general election before like this. \n\nIn 2016, Parliament's Home Affairs Select Committee ran an inquiry into anti-semitism in the UK and devoted a substantial part of their report to the Labour party. The Committee found \"no reliable, empirical evidence to support the notion that there is a higher prevalence of antisemitic attitudes within the Labour Party than any other political party\" - indeed it's by no means the worst - but said the leadership's lack of action \"risks lending force to allegations that elements of the Labour movement are institutionally antisemitic\". \n\nThe Committee criticised the Chakrabati Inquiry report into anti-semitism in the Labour party published earlier in the same year, describing it as \"compromised\", and said Corbyn didn't understand \"the distinct nature of post-second-world-war antisemitism\".\n\n\n  Clearly, the Labour Leader is not directly responsible for abuse\n  committed in his name, but we believe that his lack of consistent\n  leadership on this issue, and his reluctance to separate antisemitism\n  from other forms of racism, has created what some have referred to as\n  a ‘safe space’ for those with vile attitudes towards Jewish people.\n  This situation has been further exacerbated by the Party’s\n  demonstrable incompetence at dealing with members accused of\n  antisemitism, as illustrated by the saga involving the suspension,\n  re-admittance and re-suspension of Jackie Walker. The ongoing\n  membership of Ken Livingstone, following his outbursts about Hitler\n  and Zionism, should also have been dealt with more effectively. The\n  result is that the Labour Party, with its proud history of fighting\n  racism and promoting equal rights, is seen by some as an unwelcoming\n  place for Jewish members and activists.\n  \n  The decision by the Leader of the Labour Party to commission an\n  independent inquiry into antisemitism was a welcome one,\n  notwithstanding subsequent criticisms. The Chakrabarti report makes\n  recommendations about creating a more robust disciplinary process\n  within the Labour Party, but it is clearly lacking in many areas;\n  particularly in its failure to differentiate explicitly between racism\n  and antisemitism. The fact that the report describes occurrences of\n  antisemitism merely as “unhappy incidents” also suggests that it fails\n  to appreciate the full gravity of the comments that prompted the\n  inquiry in the first place. These shortfalls, combined with Ms\n  Chakrabarti’s decision to join the Labour Party in April and accept a\n  peerage as a nominee of the Leader of that Party, and her subsequent\n  appointment as Shadow Attorney General, have thrown into question her\n  claims (and those of Mr Corbyn) that her inquiry was truly\n  independent. Ms Chakrabarti has not been sufficiently open with the\n  Committee about when she was offered her peerage, despite several\n  attempts to clarify this issue with her. It is disappointing that she\n  did not foresee that the timing of her elevation to the House of\n  Lords, alongside a report absolving the Labour Leader of any\n  responsibility for allegations of increased antisemitism within his\n  Party, would completely undermine her efforts to address this issue.\n  It is equally concerning that Mr Corbyn did not consider the damaging\n  impression likely to be created by this sequence of events.\n\n\nFor an organisation to be institutionally racist, we don't mean that every member is racist or even most members are racist, or that there is intent in the organisation to be racist - it is about outcomes. If the totality of the body's efforts (their complaints, procedures, investigations, disciplinaries etc) or lack of efforts lead to racist outcomes, it's institutionally racist. \n\n\n  \"the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate\n  and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or\n  ethnic origin\", which \"can be seen or detected in processes,\n  attitudes, and behaviour, which amount to discrimination through\n  unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness, and racist\n  stereotyping, which disadvantages minority ethnic people.\" - Sir\n  William Macpherson\n\n\nThere is a not unfounded perception that Labour has, over time, been very slow to investigate, failed to take action against anti-semitic members, ignored the problem, denied the existence of the problem, doubled down on causing the bad outcomes, blamed the complainants and even driven some of the complainants out of the party.\n\nIn April 2019 the Sunday Times published a story headed, \"Labour’s hate files expose Jeremy Corbyn’s anti‑semite army\" (paywall):\n\n\n  The Labour Party has failed to take disciplinary action against\n  hundreds of members accused of anti-semitism under Jeremy Corbyn’s\n  leadership, according to internal documents leaked to The Sunday\n  Times.\n  \n  A hard drive of emails and a confidential database last updated on\n  March 8 reveal how the party’s system for dealing with such complaints\n  is bedevilled by delays, inaction and interference from the leader’s\n  office. They reveal members investigated for posting such online\n  comments as “Heil Hitler”, “F*** the Jews” and “Jews are the problem”\n  have not been expelled, even though the party received the complaints\n  a year ago.\n\n\nThe newspaper claimed the leaks showed that more than half of the cases remained unresolved to March 2019 and in 28% of them there had been no investigation.\n\nIn July 2019, BBC's Panorama reported in a programme titled “Is Labour Antisemitic?” (iPlayer link) reported among other things that Corbyn’s general secretary Jennie Formby, chief of staff Karie Murphy, director of strategy Seumas Milne and adviser Andrew Murray meddled in what were supposed to be independent investigations, overruling and downgrading penalties. It appeared to be a party concerned with damage control instead of investigating complaints.\n\nWorse, Corbyn himself has often seemed to believe there hasn't been a problem or not cared if there was. He has also shared platforms with anti-semitic people, such as proponents of killing Jews (e.g. Hamas and Hezbollah) and even supported them. I think that in those respects, as in the IRA involvement, Corbyn's political judgment on this has been spectacularly poor for an MP and would-be PM. As the-then Labour Chief Whip said of Corbyn inviting two convicted IRA terrorists to Parliament two weeks after the 1984 Brighton hotel bombing: \n\n\n  I think that, unless you are very very careful, any contact with\n  people of this sort gives credence to their cause, and unless you are\n  very careful that can lead to people thinking you are actually\n  indifferent to the outrage, the suffering, the killing and the maiming\n  which is the direct consequence of the actions of people who are\n  terrorists.\n\n\nCorbyn once supported Blood Libel proponent Raed Salah, for example. Corbyn has denied being aware that such individuals have made antisemitic remarks but their remarks and affiliations have been a matter of public record - he could have looked into the people he was to support or share a platform with. So at best he was utterly careless about who he supported. Here is a timeline of some of his behaviour, some of which beggars belief.\n",

No country, not even the authoritarian ones have enough policemen to monitor every single corner. \n\nFurthermore if people violate the ban and refuse to pay the fine, what are they going to do?

When a government gives an order, or issues a prohibition, then they have to enforce it, it is also a strong commitment for the state itself. This means devoting a large portion of the police force to it while they could have been employed for other tasks. Furthermore the stronger the prohibition the higher the chance that some people may eventually challenge it and lead to confrontations with the police forces.\n\nHad there been just a ban on public events plus a recommendation to people not to gather in big number, without such a strong commitment, what would have been the difference in effectiveness and pressure put on the police force and other state resources?\n",

    "answer": "This has been explored by Berens et al. [1], from the Reputation Institute, the publishers of the annual RepTrak country reputation rankings. In their chapter in the International Place Branding Yearbook 2011, they provide an overview of their methodology, which seeks to measure a country's reputation in much the same way that one might measure the reputation of an individual or a company. \n\nThey argue that this reputation is linked intrinsically to the overall international trust of a country, something which is backed up by Klewes &amp; Wreschniok [2], which states that the link between reputation and trust is \"fundamental and indispensable\", arguing that \" trust is based on the experience\nthat an agent has fulfilled our expectations in the past.\"\n\nThey list 11 different attributes, which fit into three different dimensions. These are:\n\n\nAdvanced Economy\n\n\nAn important contributor to global culture\nIs technologically advanced\nIs inventive\nProduces high-quality products and services\n\nAppealing Environment\n\n\nOffers appealing lifestyle\nAn enjoyable country\nA beautiful country\n\nEffective Government \n\n\nOffers a favorable environment for doing business\nHas adopted progressive social and economic policies\nIs a responsible participant in the global community\nIs run by an effective government\n\n\n\nThe testing methodology consisted of a large random sample (n=26,000) of consumers in the G8 countries, combined with an additional sample (n=19,000) from the country in question drawn from its own citizens. Responses were adjusted to take into account general per-country bias - for example, respondents from Greece generally will have a good opinion of Cyprus.\n\nA further dimension which was measured was \"Supportive Behaviors\". This measured the willingness of consumers to visit, live in, invest in, work in, and buy products from the country.\n\nIn conclusion then, while the study in question is conducted by surveying populations, it seems possible that a similar study could be conducted which measures at least some of these criteria objectively. Certainly, factors such as \"willingness to invest\" and \"technological advancement\" could be measured using economic data. However, it would seem that the best way to measure the reputation of a country will probably be to survey the opinions of global respondents through large-scale polling, as the factors that the study found had the most effect on a country's reputation were attributes such as \"Offers an appealing lifestyle\", \"Is a responsible participant in the global community\", and \"Is a beautiful country\", which would seem to be more abstract factors.\n\nCitations\n\n[1]: Berens G., Fombrun C.J., Ponzi L.J., Trad N.G., Nielsen K.

    "wrong_answer": "Because the two main parties absorb emergent third parties\n\nAny time any third party starts to get serious traction in the United States, it eventually will find one of the major parties shifting its platform to absorb those voters into its coalition.\n\nUnlike most of the other parties in America, the Democrats and the Republicans are both in the business of winning elections. Allowing a third party to just show up someplace would be political malpractice of the highest order. The smart thing to do is to go straight to those voters and say \"I know the New Center Party is offering you X, we can give you X also, and we have the additional benefit of being a real governing party that can actually make that happen.\" So, that's typically what happens. \n\nEver heard of the Reform Party? It was founded by Ross Perot, who got 18.6% of the popular vote for President in 1992, and 8.1% of the popular vote in 1996. It tried to be a centrist alternative to the two other parties, and it may have cost George H. W. Bush re-election (who, it should be noted, committed political malpractice of the highest order by promising no new taxes, and then passing new taxes, thereby making a lot of his voters angry). You may have heard of some of their more famous Presidential candidates: Pat Buchanan and Donald Trump. \n\nThose two guys are Republicans now, and at the same time, what the Republican Party is about changed quite a bit, and is still in the process of changing. The Reform Party was in favor of reducing immigration; before Donald Trump, many Republican politicians wanted to increase legal immigration through comprehensive immigration reform. The Reform Party was opposed to this thing called the North American Free Trade Agreement; before Trump, many Republican politicians were in favor of free trade agreements as part of a commitment to free market economics. \n\nThe GOP saw in 1992 that there was 18.6% of the voters in the country who wanted an alternative to the other parties that they could pick up, so they expanded their tent to try to pick them up; 24 years later all of those voters who still think that way are Republican voters for Donald Trump.\n\nThis is just one worked example; other historical examples are the Progressive Party at the turn of the century, and anything that could have become a successful US Communist party.\n\nWhy didn't this happen with the Libertarian Party or the Green Party or any of those other parties you mentioned? Simple; they are not very popular, in part because most of the people who might find them ideologically pleasing are probably already voting for Republicans or Democrats just to get their achievable policy goals accomplished. So, they continue as vanity projects for rich donors and that stubborn guy who just can't let anyone be wrong on the Internet.\n\nAlso, not \"identifying with\" a party doesn't mean people will not vote for it\n\nJust because most people don't want to identify themselves as Republicans or Democrats, doesn't mean that they actually aren't willing to vote for them. It is a well known social science phenomena that most people who call themselves independents are actually moderate partisans. That is, they may say they're independent, but that doesn't mean they're as ready to jump ship for a center third party.\n",

The only official source of information about drug approvals is the FDA's list of approved drugs.  See 21 CFR 314.3:\n\n\n  Listed drug is a new drug product that has been approved under section 505(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for safety and effectiveness or under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which has not been withdrawn or suspended under section 505(e)(1) through (5) or section 505(j)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and which has not been withdrawn from sale for what FDA has determined are reasons of safety or effectiveness. Listed drug status is evidenced by the drug product's identification in the current edition of FDA's “Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” (the list) as an approved drug. A drug product is deemed to be a listed drug on the date of approval for the NDA or ANDA for that drug product.\n\n",

    "wrong_answer": "The mathematical phenomenon you're talking about is Arrow's impossibility theorem. The wiki article has an informal proof.\n\nSpecifically, the theorem states that there's no way to design a voting system such that all three of these criteria hold:\n\n\n  \n  If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y.\n  If every voter's preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group's preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters' preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change).\n  There is no \"dictator\": no single voter possesses the power to always determine the group's preference.\n  \n\n\n(The theorem is stated in terms of a rank-order voting system. The winner-take-all and first-past-the-post systems are degenerate cases of this; each voter is asked only for their first preference, and the candidate who is the first preference of a majority or plurality of voters wins.)\n\nEvery democratic voting system fulfills the first and third criteria; therefore, they have to dispense with the second. This means that (for example) even if 60% of voters favor Candidate Alice over Candidate Bob, it's still possible for Bob to beat Alice. In a winner-take-all or first-past-the-post system, the way this would happen is through the introduction of a third candidate. If 30% of the voters now prefer Carl as their top choice, and all of those voters previously favored Alice over Bob, then Bob now has 40% of the vote while Alice and Carl each have 30%; Bob has beaten Alice. Voting systems such as instant-runoff voting can ameliorate this, but according to Arrow's impossibility theorem, they cannot entirely eliminate the possibility of a situation where Bob beats Alice even though a majority of the voters prefer Alice over Bob.\n\nThe most important practical implication of this is that a democratic voting system can't entirely eliminate the spoiler effect. More broadly, it means the possibility always exists that it's in a voter's interest to vote in a way that doesn't reflect their true preferences; in other words, tactical voting is always a factor in elections. Most people in democratic countries accept this as an unfortunate reality of the system.  Even so, some systems (such as winner-take-all) are more heavily impacted by tactical voting than others (such as instant-runoff).\n",

Getting to the details might be too involved/broad in a question like this, not specific to a pair of countries. There's for example a China-US comparison in a recent BI article, too long to quote here in its entirety, of course. But some things that were probably not done in the West was a complete shutdown of travel, e.g.\n\n\n  \"These draconian measures seem to have worked to bring down the cases in a very short period of time in China,\" Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Business Insider. \"Although there is a cost to the economy, to society, not to mention also the second-order problems, like access to health care for people without the coronavirus. The question is whether the United States is willing to pay such a high price.\" [...] Huang says he cannot imagine an America where many of these measures are implemented. [...]\n  \n  During the height of the outbreak, trains didn't stop at the disease's epicenter, Wuhan. [...] \"Cutting off transportation was considered on the top three measures to contain the spread of the virus,\" Huang told Business Insider. \"But it would hard to imagine the complete shutdown of an American city due to government order.\"\n\n\nAnd regarding tracking of people's movement\n\n\n  \"It would be a big change right for the US people to get accustomed to,\" said Huang, \"if the government wants to use this high tech means, like using the cell phones to monitor the movement of the people.\"\n  \n  Huang added that even though there is little technological barrier to doing this, this kind of behavior is considered a form of digital authoritarianism, that involves uses privacy issues. Huang would be hard-pressed to imagine the US government using this approach to containing the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\nChina also apparently co-opted every (\"private\") security guard in the effort to keep people in their homes:\n\n\n  \"In America, you have to stay at home, but there's no police,\" said Huang. \"There's no one actively enforcing that rule, but in China, you have what are basically security guards on patrol of every residence to make sure they don't violate the government containment measures. That's a kind of approach I think can't be copied here in the United States.\"\n\n\nLikewise for suspending \"non-essential\" medical access:\n\n\n  In China, elective surgeries and other non-critical doctors visits were delayed, and many medical services were moved online.

Another boy with cerebral palsy died after being left alone for six days while his father was quarantined in China. \n\n\nA similar opinion was voiced in a Time interview:\n\n\n  “No other nation (western or otherwise) can or should seek to replicate China’s actions,” Thomas Bollyky, the director of the Global Health Program at the Washington D.C.-based Council on Foreign Relations, tells TIME via email. “The disregard for civil liberties and human rights that the government has demonstrated in its quarantine and censorship activities are inseparable from the policies and actions of the government that contributed to the outbreak in the first place.”\n\n\nOther experts quoted earlier in a Science (news) piece were also skeptical that the full extent of China's measures could be copied in the West:\n\n\n  The question now is whether the world can take lessons from China’s apparent success—and whether the massive lockdowns and electronic surveillance measures imposed by an authoritarian government would work in other countries. [...]\n  \n  “This report poses difficult questions for all countries currently considering their response to COVID-19,” says Steven Riley, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London. “The joint mission was highly productive and gave a unique insight into China’s efforts to stem the virus from spread within mainland China and globally,” adds Lawrence Gostin, a global health law scholar at Georgetown University. But Gostin warns against applying the model elsewhere. “I think there are very good reasons for countries to hesitate using these kinds of extreme measures.”\n  \n  There’s also uncertainty about what the virus, dubbed SARS-CoV-2, will do in China after the country inevitably lifts some of its strictest control measures and restarts its economy. COVID-19 cases may well increase again.\n\n\nMore recent cases from Hong Kong indicate that that fear of re-emergence may well be have been justified. So Hong Kong is back into lock down after it was largely lifted at the beginning of March.\n\nSimilar expert opinion on restrictions timing:\n\n\n  Epidemiologists say China’s mammoth response had one glaring flaw: it started too late. In the initial weeks of the outbreak in December and January, Wuhan authorities were slow to report cases of the mysterious infection, which delayed measures to contain it, says Howard Markel, a public-health researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “The delay of China to act is probably responsible for this world event,” says Markel.\n  \n  A model simulation by Lai Shengjie and Andrew Tatem, emerging-disease researchers at the University of Southampton, UK, shows that if China had implemented its control measures a week earlier, it could have prevented 67% of all cases there. Implementing the measures 3 weeks earlier, from the beginning of January, would have cut the number of infections to 5% of the total. [...]\n  \n  But between 16 and 30 January, a period that included the first 7 days of the lockdown, the number of people each infected individual gave the virus to dropped to 1.05, estimates Adam Kucharski, who models infectious-disease spread at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “That was amazing,” he says. [...]\n  \n  “These extreme limitations on population movement have been quite successful,” says Michael Osterholm, an infectious-disease scientist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. [... However,] China is suppressing the virus, not eradicating it, says Osterholm. The world will need to wait until about eight weeks after China resumes to some form of normality to know what it did or didn’t accomplish with its population-movement limitations, he says.\n  \n  There is probably a fierce debate going on in China about when to relax the lockdown measures, says Roy Anderson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London. He suggests there could be a second wave of new infections when they are lifted.\n\n\nSo whether it's possible to (fully) emulate China's response (in the West) depends not only on the political framework, but also to which experts the (Western) governments might be paying [most] attention to.\n\nI realize this is a long answer already, but there was a recent interview with one of China's [own] CDC officials (whom seldom get interviewed in the West). Some interesting points from there:\n\n\n  Q: What mistakes are other countries making?\n  \n  A: The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren’t wearing masks. [...]\n  \n  Q: People who tested positive in Wuhan but only had mild disease were sent into isolation in large facilities and were not allowed to have visits from family. Is this something other countries should consider?\n  \n  A: Infected people must be isolated. [...]\n  \n  Q: Spread in China has dwindled to a crawl, and the new confirmed cases are mainly people entering the country, correct?\n  \n  A: Yes. At the moment, we don’t have any local transmission, but the problem for China now is the imported cases. So many infected travelers are coming into China.\n\n\n\n\nMore recently (April 2) it has been reported by DW that Germany is considering a voluntary phone app similar to the (mandatory?) one[s] used in China:\n\n\n  The most famous health app was developed by the tech giant Alibaba in conjunction with the Chinese authorities. Other companies have also developed similar software, however. It was possible to work swiftly because the Chinese state already has access regarding citizens' movements and programmers did not have to worry about data protection laws. [...]\n  \n  There are many who hope that Germany will soon be using such an app. The Health Ministry and researchers at the Robert Koch Institute are developing similar software. The idea is to introduce a non-compulsory app that will not be able to detect who met whom and where but will be able to identify if a phone user was in close contact with another infected user.\n  \n  The app will only really be able to function if 60 percent of the population uses it. In Germany, it won't be as easy as in Asia to reach such a percentage.\n  \n  Will Germans cooperate?\n  \n  Half of the respondents to a recent poll said they would not oppose an app to help warn users who had come into contact with someone infected with COVID-19. \n\n\nThey don't link to the poll, but I guess in was a poll in Germany given that this was an article on DW.\n\nThere's now a BBC video discussing Chinese-inspired surveillance measures to combat the outbreak. This is of course somewhat subjective, but they only short-listed Singapore, Israel, Iran, Taiwan and Russia as being closest to China-style surveillance measures used to combat the epidemic, like using CCTV cameras and phone tracking.\n",

    "question": "At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization initially opposed countries instituting travel or trade restrictions.\n\n\n\nWhy did they oppose these policies at that time? Is there any evidence that non-medical considerations such as political pressure played a role in the World Health Organization's decision?\n",

    "answer": "Probably because prior WHO research was rather skeptical of their ultimate effectiveness:  \n\n\n  Screening and quarantining entering travelers at international borders did not substantially delay virus introduction in past pandemics, except in some island countries, and will likely be even less effective in the modern era.\n\n\nThat paper was co-authored (on behalf of the WHO) by employees of the [US] CDC (lead author actually), the ECDC, the UK's HPA, Australian DHA, and some of WHO's own employees. So you could say it was a fairly broad consensus at the time it was written (2006).\n\nThe WHO has actually explained/defended their reasoning in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak in more detail in a February press release:\n\n\n  WHO continues to advise against the application of travel or trade restrictions to countries experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks.\n  \n  In general, evidence shows that restricting the movement of people and goods during public health emergencies is ineffective in most situations and may divert resources from other interventions. Furthermore, restrictions may interrupt needed aid and technical support, may disrupt businesses, and may have negative social and economic effects on the affected countries. However, in certain circumstances, measures that restrict the movement of people may prove temporarily useful, such as in settings with few international connections and limited response capacities.\n  \n  Travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic may only be justified at the beginning of an outbreak, as they may allow countries to gain time, even if only a few days, to rapidly implement effective preparedness measures. Such restrictions must be based on a careful risk assessment, be proportionate to the public health risk, be short in duration, and be reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves.\n  \n  Travel bans to affected areas or denial of entry to passengers coming from affected areas are usually not effective in preventing the importation of cases but may have a significant economic and social impact. Since WHO declaration of a public health emergency of international concern in relation to COVID-19, and as of 27 February, 38 countries have reported to WHO additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic in relation to travel to and from China or other countries, ranging from denial of entry of passengers, visa restrictions or quarantine for returning travellers. Several countries that denied entry of travellers or who have suspended the flights to and from China or other affected countries, are now reporting cases of COVID-19.\n  \n  Temperature screening alone, at exit or entry, is not an effective way to stop international spread, since infected individuals may be in incubation period, may not express apparent symptoms early on in the course of the disease, or may dissimulate fever through the use of antipyretics; in addition, such measures require substantial investments for what may bear little benefits. [...]\n\n\nI haven't found more recent press releases on this matter, especially after the US and the EU have imposed much more wider travel bans. I do wonder the extent to which the WHO might have reconsidered that initial approach...\n\nAside, comment on the question... I wonder why you found it necessary to use \"that guy from India\" as the motivator for this question when (in the US) a poll published on March 26 says...\n\n\n  In thinking about specific steps that have been announced to address the coronavirus outbreak, majorities of Republicans and Democrats view a range of measures as necessary to stem the spread of the virus. For example, overwhelming majorities of both Republicans (96%) and Democrats (94%) say restricting international travel to the U.S. is necessary.\n\n",

    "question": "The US has enacted law H.R.6201 - Families First Coronavirus Response Act which seems to mainly tackle elementary/secondary students' food availability, but also expanded FMLA among other things. I've seen various posts on Facebook that are, at best, outdated or, at worst, straight-up false. Some of the posts I've seen state that the US is requiring 2-week paid leave. But the summary of the law makes it sound like that falls to the state's unemployment program. When reading the actual text of the law regarding paid leave, it states that the first 10 days are unpaid; any leave after that is paid. So what does paid leave look like then?\n\nFor example, my place of business is shutting down next week, March 30th, and maybe subsequent weeks. I'm told that I can use PTO (of which I have none) or draw unemployment. Assuming that COVID-19 cases skyrocket in my county and we shutdown for more than 10 days, do I start getting paid on Day 11?\n\nTo further muddy the water, there is an exemption for businesses with fewer than 50 employees. I think this replaces the previous exemption of businesses with more than 500 employees. \n\nIf the above is correct, let's say my factory (in Kansas) has 150 employees, but is owned by a company (national, but headquartered in Michigan) with >>500 employees. The company is a subsidiary of a larger, international corporation (I have no idea how many are employed under the corporation). \n\nDo I still qualify for paid leave on Day 1? Day 11? Not at all (this is America; bootstraps etc)? \n\nAssume that I am a healthy, essential employee with no children. Why we're still shutting down despite being deemed essential is beyond me.\n",

    "question": "With the news that Boris Johnson has tested positive for COVID-19, and was later hospitalised, a question occurred to me: \n\nWhat happens if the UK Prime Minister suddenly dies?  \n\nI know that the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the party with the most seats, and presumably the party would somehow choose a new leader as soon as they can.  However, organizing a vote of the Conservative part membership would still require at least a few days under normal circumstances;  and under the current circumstances, it might take significantly longer.  \n\nIs there simply no Prime Minister until the governing party can choose another one?

    "answer_id": "51247",
    "answer": "Your understanding is correct - there is no UK Prime Minister until one is appointed by the Queen. In the meantime, the Civil Contingencies Act (2004) gives the Monarch (in practice, government ministers) powers to make emergency regulations, and COBRA meetings can be chaired by any Cabinet minister - after 9/11, these were chaired by the Cabinet Secretary until the PM could attend himself.\n\nThe Queen will appoint as PM the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons. In practice, this is the person chosen as the leader of the party with the most MPs - in this case, the party that the deceased PM previously led. How this is chosen, and how quickly, will depend on the party in question, although in these circumstances it seems likely that an interim leader would be speedily chosen. The Labour Party's rules for this are described in Steve Melnikoff's answer here. In the case of the Conservative Party, their constitution states under Schedule 2 - Rules for the Election of the Leader that:\n\n\n  \n  Upon the initiation of an election for the Leader, it shall be the\n  duty of the 1922 Committee to present to the Party, as soon as\n  reasonably practicable, a choice of candidates for election as Leader.\n  The rules for deciding the procedure by which the 1922 Committee\n  selects candidates for submission for election shall be determined by\n  the Executive Committee of the 1922 Committee after consultation of\n  the Board. \n  If there is only one candidate at the time laid down for\n  the close of nominations, that candidate shall be declared Leader of\n  the Party.\n  \n\n\nIt would be possible, then, for MPs to be strongly encouraged to only nominate one candidate in order to conclude this process as quickly as possible, without a full membership vote. You may remember in 2016, for example, Andrea Leadson withdrew from the leadership contest leaving Theresa May as the sole candidate, which meant that there was no ballot of the party membership.\n\nIn the specific case you raise, however, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was given the role of 'Designated Survivor' on March 22nd, and will carry out Johnson's duties that he can't perform himself while he is affected by the virus. It should be noted that this role is not an official post, and if Johnson were to die from the virus then it is not a given that Raab would be appointed leader of the party and therefore the new PM. In fact, the article notes that this designation was challenged by some in the Cabinet, who thought that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, should have been given the role, and  indeed; Gove replaced Johnson at the daily press briefing on March 27th. Another contender might be Jeremy Hunt, against whom Johnson won the Conservative  Party leadership election in 2019.\n\nAs for other Westminster systems, there is no blanket answer to that question. It is perfectly possible for a bill to be introduced that immediately designates the new Prime Minister on their death, as in the US system. Indeed, in 2013, Peter Bone MP introduced the Prime Minister (Replacement) Bill, which contains the following provision:\n\n\n  In the event of the death or incapacitation of a person holding the\n  title of Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury, the title,\n  salary and functions of that role shall be conferred upon another\n  Secretary or Minister of State in accordance with the following order\n  of precedence— \n  \n  \n  (a) person bearing the designation of Deputy Prime\n  Minister; \n  (b) Secretary of State with responsibility for Home Affairs;\n  (c) Secretary of State with responsibility for Defence;\n  ...\n  \n\n\nThis bill did not make it onto the statute books, but it proves the point that it is possible for an order of succession to exist in a Westminster system.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "TL;DR Yes, see \"primitive communism\".\n\nThere is no NPOV answer to your questions, it all depends on your definitions and judgment of evidence. My answer is an attempt to explain things according to the point of view of Marx &amp; Engels.\n\nFull disclosure: I consider myself a communist.\n\nAccording to Marx, the answer to the question is Yes.\n\nTo be communist, a society MUST be non-dictatorial - as dictatorship necessarily requires a state to control the means of production. If you do not have a means of coercion to control the means of production (army, police, etc.) - then you do not have a state.\n\n\n  \"When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of\n  a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its\n  political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely\n  the organized power of one class for oppressing another. If the\n  proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by\n  the force of circumstances, to organize itself as a class; if, by\n  means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such,\n  sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will,\n  along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the\n  existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will\n  thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class. In place of the\n  old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we\n  shall have an association in which the free development of each is the\n  condition for the free development of all.\", Communist Manifesto,\n  Chapter 2\n\n\nTherefore it is a logical impossibility that there should be communist society that is dictatorial. Rather, the question is then: Has there ever been a communist society? If there has not been, then the answer to your question is No, otherwise Yes.\n\nCommunist societies have existed before the state ever existed, in the form that Marx refers to as \"primitive communism\"\n\nAdding to the requirement of a stateless and classless society - in order to have communism, you must also abolish value itself. In Marxist theory, value is not the same as prince, and value is not the same as exchange value or use value. In Marx terms, value is the 'socially necessary abstract labor' embodied in a commodity. A commodity is any good or service produced by human labor and offered as a product for general sale on the market. To abolish value, you must abolish commodities and therefore markets.\n\n@DVK is mostly incorrect, but @jvm is incorrect in other aspects too:\n\n@jvm: Marx was certainly a Marxist, but said he was not as a way of saying, \"if this is Marxism, then I'm not a Marxist\" against the French communists &amp; Paul Lafargue. Discussion on: I'm not a Marxist\n\nNow to the few examples pointed out: Early christian communites, Kibbutzim, early workers' soviets (= councils) in Russia, The Paris Commune, Anarchism during the spanish civil war, particularly around Barcelona.\n\nIn none of these examples can we reasonably expect that the market or state was abolished as these societies either operated within a bigger picture where it was not abolished. In early Soviet Russia just after the revolution the market was certainly not dissolved. The Paris Commune was attacked and had armed forces. If you trade with places where the market still exists then commodities still exist. Anarchism during the Spanish Civil War was during a civil war - therefore they were fighting to uphold a means of production - therefore not communism.\n\nThe claim that @DVK makes that communism would somehow be an impossibility due to genes and how we evolved, i.e: \"greed is in human nature\" would require some scientific claims in the field of neuroscience and evolutionary biology. When it comes to biology, we are as genetically close to the violent chimpanzees as to the sharing bonobos that are the only other species except for us that uses sex for pleasure. One thing is for certain: cooperation is what made us the #1 apex predator species of the world. One human vs. one tiger is one well fed tiger. A few humans with tools against a tiger is a dead tiger.\n\nOne needs to remember that Capitalism had centuries to mature into the state it is in now - it had bloody revolutions, dictatorships, etc. One can't expect that the communist movement needs to honor \"three strikes &amp; you are out\".\n",

But the amount antivirals available might not suffice in the short run, even if they prove [safe and] effective.\n\nGenerally speaking however\n\n\n  Given the lack of testing in Europe and the US, the only way to keep the sick and healthy apart is to keep everyone apart. And that produces a recession.\n\n\nAnd the alternative for that would be to test everyone. It's been done at small scale (you'll be amused where) in Italy, in the very first region hit, i.e. in the town of Vò. But the trouble is that testing capacity doesn't quite scale to the \"test everyone in the country\" presently... except maybe in Iceland, the only country I know of that that is doing random testing on a serious scale (relative to the country's size); but it's worth noting that there's convergence between random testing and the chunk of the population that gets tested in Iceland:\n\n\n  Iceland has tested a far greater proportion of its population than anywhere else on earth, including South Korea — another country touted for its effective response to the pandemic.\n  \n  But what makes Iceland unique is that test samples are not only taken from ‘high risk’ individuals who have exhibited symptoms, came into contact with known carriers, or returned from countries such as China and Italy, they are also offered to thousands of ordinary members of its general population, who are nonsymptomatic.\n\n\nOn should not discount the level of quarantines imposed in Iceland either though:\n\n\n  Across this remote and rugged island nation of a little more than 364,000, as of Friday morning there were almost 10,000 men, women and children — equivalent to 9 million Americans — under this form of state-enforced lock and key.\n\n\nSo it's more like \"more of everything\" being done over there rather than \"alternative plans\".\n\n\n\nIf by plans you mean plans to relax the lockdowns at some point, every country is probably thinking/considering when they can do that. Economists have been spurred into providing answers to hard-choice questions that need to balance economic damage/recession with the lives saved (in the short run). See e.g.\n\n\n\"Managing economic lockdowns in an epidemic\", or in more depth\n\"The Macroeconomics of Epidemics\" (Eichenbaum et al.); also covered in (the latter half of a) NYT article.\n\n\nAlas the experience of Hong Kong last week shows that lockdowns may [need to] return in some cases/areas...\n\n\n\nI somehow missed the \"odd man out\", in this case, Bolsonaro:\n\n\n  In a televised address last week, he repeated a now well-worn phrase. \"It's just a little flu or the sniffles,\" he said, blaming the media once again for the hysteria and panic over Covid-19.\n  \n  A few days later, he clearly demonstrated his prioritisation of the economy over isolation measures favoured by the rest of the world.\n  \n  \"People are going to die, I'm sorry,\" he said. \"But we can't stop a car factory because there are traffic accidents.\"\n  \n  \"Jair Bolsonaro is alone right now,\" says Brian Winter, editor-in-chief of the publication Americas Quarterly. \"No other major world leader is denying the severity of this to the extent [...]\n  \n  A few days ago, a video was shared by Jair Bolsonaro's son, Flavio - a politician himself.\n  \n  The video's message, which claimed to come from the Brazilian government, was that \"BRAZIL CAN'T STOP\" (in Portuguese, #obrasilnãopodeparar).

He had previously said a \"lockdown\" would not be sustainable in Pakistan, as it would cause too much harm to those on low incomes.\n  \n  After provincial governments went ahead and introduced measures tantamount to a \"lockdown\" anyway, Mr Khan attempted to explain he only opposed what he described as a \"curfew,\" while also outlining some measures to protect the poorest in society, who are dependent on daily wages to feed their families.

It should read the 13th rather than the 14th.\n\nFurther, the MEPs could arguably sit at some point by the end of the month to get this passed -- and I'd wager will, if British MPs pass Johnson's bill.\n\nThat said, even if British MPs do pass the bill, I wouldn't be the slightest bit surprised if MEPs end up looking into the text several days later. Insofar as their reputation goes and insofar as I've seen from watching anecdotal debates, MEPs tend to come very well prepared to debates. Given this, I'd suggest they'd be rather unimpressed with a third party sticking a gun to their faces and trying to get them to vote under pressure. So much so, in fact, that  I could totally imagine Verhofstadt pushing to get some kind of language in the coming extension so that, if they're not done deciding themselves, it kicks in even if British MPs end up passing Johnson's deal at the last minute.\n\nOn the flip side, you can safely bet that MEPs as a group are well prepared for the coming bill already, and continuing to prepare. This has a long history in fact. Barnier has been explaining what his team has been doing every single week since the whole thing began, and their negotiation strategy was out in the open for everyone to read. As such, and in stark contrast with British MPs, who had no idea of what was going on or of what was heading their way until the last minute agreement was passed, with only a few days to go through the thing and conduct an analysis of whether they like it, MEP aides who were following the topic had, if not the word for word legalese, at least a fairly good idea of what was heading their way already.\n\n(Just to be clear, no one is expecting that MEPs passing the Johnson deal will be anything other than a formality. I'm merely suggesting that they will do their due diligence regardless.)\n\n\n\nEdit: I reached out to the Guardian article's author for further thoughts. He's suggesting that MEPs won't sit again after the 24th, but didn't say why. Will update this if/when he does.\n\nHe also suggested in a prior article that the EU would accept an extension if asked, and apparently Johnson will send a letter to that effect tonight.\n",

    "question": "CNBC reported that:\n\n\n  [Dan] Patrick, the Texas lieutenant governor, said Monday on Fox News, “As a senior citizen, are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren? And if that is the exchange, I’m all in.”\n\n\nApparently on the same show another fairly high profile US politician said\n\n\n  SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): For a small segment of our population, it's true, the coronavirus can kill you. For a small segment.\n  \n  But you know what else can kill you? Poverty. Hunger. Losing the entire economy.\n  \n  And we need to stop thinking about the next election and try to think a little more about the next generation and what we leave to them, which is going to be the little end of nothing if we let this economy collapse.\n\n\nAccording to CNN (which alas doesn't link to the actual polls they mention):\n\n\n  The often-dismissive messaging from Fox News hosts was notable, given that the viewers who make up the network's audience skew older and are thus more vulnerable to the disease.\n  \n  Polls from both Gallup and Pew Research revealed that Republicans — who are largely distrustful of mainstream news organizations and primarily turn to Fox News and other right-wing sources for information on current events — were much less likely to take the risks of the coronavirus as seriously as their Democratic counterparts.\n\n\nOf course, this being a rather emotionally charged judgement, it probably matters a lot how one phrases such a question/choice. Still, I want to know if there any surveys in the US on how much the public sees the mortality risk posed by COVID-19 (which as we know is most elevated for the elderly) as acceptable in balance with preserving the \"American way of life\", \"keeping America great\", or some other equivalently formulated socioeconomic normality [for the US]?\n\n\n\nBefore I get anymore downvotes, please note that I'm not endorsing those views... but they do exist in various shapes, e.g.\n\n\n  As fears of COVID-19 spread, so too have ageist messages suggesting that the coronavirus is a disease of the old, with internet memes referring to the virus as a ‘boomer remover.’ \n\n\nOn the less frivolous side, the NYT has an article [sub]titled: \"Shutdown Spotlights Economic Cost of Saving Lives. President Trump and others have asked if halting normal life and commerce to fight the coronavirus is worth the cost. Here’s how economists figure it. [...]\n\n\n  “Economists should be doing this cost-benefit analysis,” said Walter Scheidel, an economic historian at Stanford University. “Why is nobody putting some numbers on the economic costs of a monthlong or a yearlong shutdown against the lives saved? The whole discipline is well equipped for it. But there is some reluctance for people to stick their neck out.”\n\n\n(For more on economics aspects of the crisis, see this econ SE question.)\n\nSo I think I'm well justified in asking this question, i.e. how widespread such views might be, especially when it comes to making a [hard] choice.\n",

A larger share of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (81%) than Republicans and GOP leaners (61%) view this requirement as necessary.\n\n\nSo most are (now) approving of not-business-as-usual measures to combat the epidemic. Actually, a bit later, this Pew poll details the public response to a few more specific measures, although this is aftery had been anounced/implemented:\n\n\n\nAs some [polling] pundits predicted a week ago after commenting on those old-by-now polls (of March 20 or so):\n\n\n  Pew shows that 59% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say the \"outbreak is a major threat to the health of the U.S. population as a whole,\" while only 33% of Republicans and Republican leaners agree.\n  \n  It is certainly possible that this significant partisan gap in views of the coronavirus situation will narrow in the weeks ahead. Partisans take cues from the statements of their leaders, and Trump and other Republican politicians initially were publicly skeptical of the significance of the virus, in some instances claiming that it reflected a partisan effort by Democrats and \"the media\" to criticize Trump. Now, Trump and his allies have begun to move away from that previous posture and are at the forefront of proclaiming the seriousness of the crisis. As media observers have noted, this in turn has brought about shifts in the tone of the coverage by Fox News, and these shifts may narrow the partisanship gap in the days and weeks to come if rank-and-file Republicans follow the cues given by their favored thought leaders.\n\n",

Any other state would need to be admitted to the EU if not through the regular accession procedure, at least through some ad hoc agreement with all current members.\n\nBut in reality, such a break-up would be such a momentous event that it would certainly be handled at highest level, in the European Council, on a case-by-case basis. And if all members agree, it's always possible to find some sort of solution, if needed by amending the treaties or creating new ones (cf. everything that has been done during the ongoing Euro crisis). The rest does not matter all that much.\n\nAnd therein lies the rub: Some current members, first and foremost Spain, are very hostile to giving EU membership for breakaway regions, for fear of bolstering similar movements in their own country. Case in point, Mariano Rajoy, Spain's current prime minister repeatedly stated publicly that Spain would not allow Scotland to remain in the union in case it became independent and did it again last week. That means that even the regular route to membership could be closed in such a scenario (current members can basically veto a candidacy indefinitely, like Greece and Bulgaria are doing to Macedonia over the name of the country).\n",

[...]\n  \n  “We put a lot of weight on saving lives,” said Casey Mulligan, a University of Chicago economist who spent a year as chief economist on Mr. Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers. “But it’s not the only consideration. That’s why we don’t shut down the economy every flu season. They’re ignoring the costs of what they’re doing. They also have very little clue how many lives they’re saving.” [...]\n  \n  “Making people poorer has health consequences as well,” said Kip Viscusi, an economist at Vanderbilt University who has spent his career using economic techniques to assess the costs and benefits of government regulations.\n  \n  Jobless people sometimes commit suicide. The poor are likelier to die if they get sick. Mr. Viscusi estimates that across the population, every loss of income of $100 million in the economy causes one additional death.\n  \n  Government agencies calculate these trade-offs regularly. The Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, has established a cost of about $9.5 million per life saved as a benchmark for determining whether to clean up a toxic waste site.\n  \n  Other agencies use similar values to assess whether to invest in reducing accidents at an intersection or to tighten safety standards in a workplace. The Department of Agriculture has a calculator to estimate the economic costs — medical care, premature deaths, productivity loss from nonfatal cases — of food-borne disease.\n\n\nSo, the argument [in there] is that governments always make such trade-offs/choices, whether they are incredibly open about them or less so.\n\n\n\nI should also mention (here, in case comments get purged again) that the NYT article discusses in a bit more depth the finer points of balancing the economic losses from lockdowns with those that would occur in an unchecked epidemic. This topic has been a addressed in some recent economics publications, e.g. Eichenbaum et al. discussed in the NYT article; but see also a simpler \"lockdowns 101 economics\".

    "title": "Has the WHO said anything about travel restrictions since the end of February?",
    "question": "The WHO was against travel restrictions as they detailed in a press release at the end of February. But in the month past (March) practically every country on earth has instituted travel restrictions, most recently China, which is now afraid of being reinfected from abroad.\n\nSo, has the WHO changed their public stance in any way about travel restrictions by now? I searched a bit, but it seems they've gone mum on the topic of travel, while (of course) strongly advocating for social distancing in general. (Aside: the WHO wants us to use \"physical distancing\" as the more appropriate term for that.)\n\nI haven't done anything like a survey on this, but clearly some governments include \"minimize travel\" in the physical distantincing advice they give, e.g. Australia's \n\n\n  Government advice for implementing physical distancing has mainly urged people to isolate themselves in space: staying at least 1.5 metres apart, working from home, avoiding gatherings, and minimising travel.\n\n\nSo maybe the WHO has done the same somewhere in their recommendations and I've missed it.\n\nLikewise, there have been at least three (high-profile) publications in Science this month on this:\n\n\nMarch 6\n\n\n  the travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in Mainland China, but has a more marked effect at the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.\n\nMarch 25\n\n\n  It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.\n\nMarch 31\n\n\n  The Wuhan shutdown was associated with the delayed arrival of COVID-19 in other cities by 2.91 days (95%CI: 2.54-3.29). [...] This analysis provided no evidence that the prohibition of travel between cities, which was implemented after and in addition to the Wuhan shutdown on 23 January, reduced the number of cases in other cities across China. These results are robust to the choice of statistical regression model. [It also analyzes, and finds effective (via association), most city-level social-distancing measures:] Our model suggests that, without the Wuhan travel ban or the national emergency response, there would have been 744,000 (± 156,000) confirmed COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan by 19 February, day 50 of the epidemic. With the Wuhan travel ban alone, this number would have decreased to 202,000 (± 10,000) cases. With the national emergency response alone (without the Wuhan travel ban), the number of cases would have decreased to 199,000 (± 8500). Thus, neither of these interventions would, on their own, have reversed the rise in incidence by 19 February. But together and interactively, these control measures offer an explanation of why the rise in incidence was halted and reversed, limiting the number of confirmed cases reported to 29,839 (fitted model estimate 28,000 ± 1400 cases), 96% fewer than expected in the absence of interventions.\n\n\n\nSo maybe there's a \"wind of change\" in the scientific community on this, maybe not, but perhaps it's too early to tell what the consensus might become on this. So I'm \"holding off\" on accepting the answer below for now (based on a non-mention in a March 11 WHO statement) as rather inconclusive.\n",

Medical systems in poor countries usually have little capacity to deal with a huge number of cases. They also don't have a way for effective testing for the virus, laboratories... The question is to what extent can humanitarian help be made available.  \n\n\"Rich countries\" and international organizations providing governance, medicine, and other resources are currently in the core of epidemics themselves. This crisis is also economically challenging, which adds prohibitive cost to invest in humanitarian help for poorer countries. IMF is currently planning to lend around $1trn to developing countries, and hopefully, G20 will also provide at least some humanitarian capacity to help them. From a political point of perspective, China can use this as an opportunity to extend its influence over developing economies requiring help with fighting Covid virus.\n\nProhibitive measures could also be used by some of the political regimes to tighten their grip on power which could lead to destabilization.\n\nOn the other hand for example in India, you have a huge pharmaceutical sector which makes medicine, which can help in providing antibiotics or other types of medicine which could be beneficial for sick people.\n\nThe virus could also be weakened by a warm climate, which is not yet scientifically proven. Population structure in poor countries is usually much younger, which is another benefit, although people can be malnourished and have different medical problems which could make things worse if they were to become infected by Coronavirus.\n\nSources, to read more:  The coronavirus could devastate poor countries  economist-coronavirus-in-india\n",

    "question": "Why have some governments banned outbound international flights in response to COVID-19?\n\nFor example, the Philippines initially announced (but later reversed) a ban on outbound flights:\n\n\n  Airports in Luzon [large island in Philippines where the capital, Manila, is located] will stop all outbound international flights starting Friday after the government gave a 72-hour window to all those who wish to leave the country after heightened measures were put in place to control the spread of COVID-19.\n  \n  https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/3/17/Philippines-international-flights-coronavirus-Luzon-quarantine.html\n\n\nThe New York Times has an article on travel bans that identifies a few other cases of countries with outbound travel bans, including:\n\n\nNamibia: \"suspending inbound and outbound flights from Qatar, Ethiopia and Germany for 30 days\"\nBolivia: \"cessation of all flights to and from Europe\"\nPeru: \"The measure means all international flights will be canceled. \"\n\n\nI understand the ban of inbound international flights to prevent contaminated individuals from entering the country, but banning outbound flights seems less obvious to me.\n",

    "answer": "Another possibility, ignoring fears of infection, is that the country doesn't want their citizens to become stranded in another country if flights are suspended at a later date. For example, on Monday, March 30th, the UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced a £75m plan to charter flights to repatriate stranded Britons, and also advised any citizens still in countries where commercial flights remain available to fly home as soon as possible.\n\nIf a country's citizens become stranded abroad it will usually end up being the government's responsibility to fly them home.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "As you rightly mentioned in your question, arguments in favour of majority government is that they tend to last much longer, bringing with it an element of stability. Whether you support the party in power or not, a majority government brings with it a clear sense of what to expect for a particular mandate period. In the Canadian political system, some argue that majorities are not healthy because it lacks a system of checks and balances (like the US system) and gives the prime minister and his or her government virtually the power to do almost anything they want throughout their time in office. A united opposition would be unable to prevent government measures from passing. Good if you support the governing party; not so good if your political views or priorities are not aligned with the government. \n\nMinority governments are interesting because they compel the governing party (which is usually the party with a plurality of seats in the House of Commons) to find common ground with one or more opposition parties. This forces upon elected officials to communicate and collaborate on the issues and to pass laws which, ideally, would benefit a larger swath of the population. \n\nThe downside to minority governments are many; however. First of all, with a shelf life averaging just over 2 years, there is a cost to the taxpayer in terms of the frequency of general elections. For example, since 2001, Canada has seen elections in 2004 (Martin minority), 2006 (Harper minority), 2008 (Harper minority), 2011 (Harper majority) and 2015 (Trudeau majority). Each election comes with a $375-million price-tag, with the 2015 election roughly double that amount as it was the longest election period in Canadian history. \n\nThe other downside is that minority governments often get defeated trying to accomplish the very things they set out to do in the electoral platform. Electing a minority government doesn't give the public a sense of predictability about what the government may do, because they require support from the opposition who come with their own demands. Political platforms are essentially invalid with a minority government either because they don't have the support to fulfill those promises, no time to complete them (being defeated before passing anything they've promised) or fulfilling part of their promises with some alterations proposed by opposition parties.  \n\nAnother element to minority governments in recent Canadian elections is the changing of political party leaders. The Liberals have gone through 6 party leaders since 2006 (including interim leaders); The Progressive Conservatives went through this kind of phase after the Joe Clark government was defeated, and again when the Reform Party was established. When you combine party leadership ballots and the volatility of minority governments, it can really give someone the sense of a continuous, never-ending election cycle. \n\nWhich is better? It really all depends on what you value in our political system. Do you want collaboration over certainty? Do you want predictability or the power to remove an incompetent government? \n",

However, when the FDA authorizes the use of a product due to an emergency condition, does that mean that there is no requirement to demonstrate safety and effectiveness?\n\nPresumably the FDA has some regulatory threshold between \"not proven safe\" and \"proven safe\" where it issues emergency use authorizations. So, to what degree are safety standards relaxed when an FDA Emergency Use Authorization is used in lieu of a standard FDA approval?\n\nSecond question: while it is obviously that the relaxation of standards is influenced by the severity of the emergency, but does that relaxation threshold also vary with political and or corporate pressures? \n",

    "answer": "Looking on the FDA website, I found this: \n\nNotice of Declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for medical countermeasures against COVID-19\n\nIn brief, it lays out that the Secretary of Health and Human Services is offering limited immunity from lawsuits and prosecution — at his considered discretion — for medicines and equipment to be used against the Covid-19 pandemic. It allows approved equipment and medicines to be used in 'off-label' or unapproved ways, and allows drugs that are being researched under 'investigative' exemptions, or even drugs or products that the Secretary decides could reasonably be on the market within 10 years (meaning drugs that are early in development, and not yet thoroughly tested). The FDA is still holding the reigns — it has the final say in determining that a drug or device is at least marginally safe — but it is setting aside the exhaustive testing and approval processes it normally requires before allowing general use.\n\nSection IV to VI spell out what is and is not covered by this immunity during the Crisis, but it seems the standard being used is that the drug or device has a credible purpose in dealing with some aspect of Covid-19 and is not grossly or flagrantly irresponsible to use.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "If you are a diehard Republican, you may be tempted to vote in a Democratic primary in order to boost one of their candidates that you believe may have a more difficult time during the general election than the other.  I have had republican friends telling me they keep cheering Bernie Sanders on, because in their perspective he will have a harder time getting elected than Hillary Clinton, for example.  This would be a bigger deal in election years where one party has a contested primary and the other one doesn't (meaning there's not too much of a reason for people to go vote in one of them, so why not vote in the other?). This happens generally every other presidential election cycle, since a president who can run for another term generally does so with their party's support.\n\nBesides this fear of crossover voters 'stealing' the primary away from people who actually are in the party, one bonus purported from here is that a closed primary tends to let candidates talk more openly about their views during the primary since they are largely just speaking to their base.  This could let the party know more about the attitude of their base by seeing which candidates get better reactions from the issues they choose to support.  It should be noted that some look to this as one of the failings of the closed primary; politicians should stand for issues that are good for all of their constituents, not just those in their own party.\n\nYou hear pundits talk about the general election 'pivot' because of this, and why I'm not sure you can really take anything anyone says at face value during a primary election anyway.  Of course, as that link states, there's not much stopping me from changing party affiliation at any time and voting in whatever primary I choose.  \"Ultimately, the parties must trust voters.\"\n\nLastly, here's a quote from Bernie Sanders printed by the NYTimes that points out in a closed primary, people who choose not to affiliate get left out:\n\n\n  “Today, three million people in the state of New York who are Independents have lost their right to vote in the Democratic and Republican primaries,” Mr. Sanders said standing alongside Mr. Cantalupo. “That’s wrong. You’re paying for this election. It’s administered by the state. You have a right to vote. That’s a very unfortunate thing which I hope will change.”\n\n\nIn my home state, the primary election is semi-closed, meaning independents can choose to vote in either the democratic or republican primaries.  The only catch is that, if there's a run-off in either, you can only vote in the run-off for the primary that you actually voted in.\n",

    "question": "It is widely considered that the passing of the corona virus bill in Hungary is a huge step towards dictatorship. (See, for example, here: https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-viktor-orban-rule-by-decree/)\n\nThe main argument is that:\n\n\nThe bill allows prime minister Orban to rule by decree infinitely (at least as long as he sees fit) and that\nThere is no real need for these measures even during the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nBut what remains is the question whether there is any need for such measures. From my view as a outsider, I can't really see any benefits concerning the fight against the pandemic. Fidesz already has a two-third majority in parliament, enabling it to rule mostly unhindered and is even  able to change the constitution if deemed necessary. Any (tough) measures could probably be passed easily by Fidesz without Orbán having to be able to rule by decree.\n\nOf course, if someone would like to transform the country into a dictatorship, these measures would make a lot of sense.

An expiry of \"after the pandemic\" would be too fuzzy. \n\n\n\nMy personal opinion is that the parliament should have found a way to stay relevant, but the question asked for possible justifications.\n\nAn option might have been to change parliamentary rules to reduce the quorum, possibly combined with pairing, or to allow online debates and voting, but those are difficult for democracy as well.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "WTO rules are much less favourable than the deal that the UK currently has with the EU. There would be mandatory tariffs in both directions, forcing up prices. The UK would lose things like EU certifications for aircraft and vehicles too.\n\nWTO rules are designed to be a minimum level on which countries trade, only used in the absence of better deals.\n\nThere are also problems with the WTO rules themselves. For a start they require equal treatment for all countries operating under them, and given that the Irish border must remain open it's a problem for both the UK and EU. The EU would not want an open border with a WTO-rules country because it would be obliged to offer the same to all other WTO-rules countries, as would the UK. That threatens peace in Ireland and both economies.\n\nFinally, it's not clear that the UK can actually trade on WTO rules as freely as some people claim. Other members have already lodged complaints over the UK's allocation of EU quotas, and in the event of a no-deal crash out would doubtless lodge more over the open border with Ireland. Disputes in the WTO take years to resolve and can be used as leverage to get trade deals less favourable to the UK.\n",

    "question": "Decision on how long to keep the economy \"shut down\" depends on the evaluation of how deadly/infectious coronavirus is. \n\nSo I would assume that countries would try to test random members of \"healthy\"(no sign of illness) population to determine the spread in the population.\n\nI assume this was not done because tests are in high demand for people that exhibit symptoms, but could not find any confirmation for my thesis.\n\nThere is this question from 3 weeks ago, but from what I understand no answer claims there is a generalized sampling.\n",
    "answer_id": "52403",
    "answer": "This may seem counterintuitive, but constructing and administering a properly random testing paradigm is difficult and time-consuming. It's not as though we can gather everyone in a big room, put their names in a hat, and then call them out one-by-one to get tested. There are a number of different issues that need to be resolved, e.g.:\n\n\nPeople are not randomly distributed. In the real world they cluster by race, religion, economic status, political affiliation, occupation, and other demographic factors. A purely random sample (unless it's immense) will likely underrepresent or overrepresent specific populations.\nPeople are not easy to find. Say that Joe Smith is someone randomly chosen to be tested. What if we can't reach him by phone or email? What if we send a testing kit to him and he neglects to return it, or uses the kit incorrectly? What if we send a 'swabber' to his house, only to find he isn't home, or refuses to open the door? Depending on methodology, sampling in this context can have massive non-participation, and the more non-participants we see, the weaker our statistical results are.\nPeople are not infected entirely randomly. Infections are a Markov chain, where one must be in specific kinds of contact with an infected person to have a chance of being infected, and then (if infected) must be in the same specific kinds of contact with uninfected people to pass it on. Modeling a Markov chain as though it were purely random misses important aspects of the way a disease is spread, and will skew results badly.\nPerhaps most importantly, the spread of a pandemic is a fluid situation, not a stable characteristic of individuals. Collecting physical samples from people requires a tremendous amount of time and labor (driving to a home and collecting a sample, driving to another home and collecting a sample, repeat, repeat, drive back to homes where people were absent and try again). Even if we could muster a veritable army of 'swabbers' for our random sampling of nearly 400 million people, we can expect the actually swabbing to take at least a week (generously), and in a week the number of infections has doubled and doubled again. The first people swabbed are not being drawn from the same statistical population as the last people swabbed, and our statistics will suffer. And then we have to ask about our swabbers, who are all part of the population we are sampling, and all of whom have been exposed to large numbers of potentially infected people...\n\n\nThe upshot is that if we were to take the time to properly construct and implement a large-scale random sample, the disease would be spreading while we were designing the methodology, the disease would be spreading while we were implementing the testing, and by the time we finished running the data we collected the disease would have spread further, making our results all but useless. I'm not saying they would be entirely useless — with appropriate statistical manipulations we can account for many of these issues — but whatever use it has will be for future epidemiologists looking back on this pandemic.\n",
    "answer_type": "Reasonable",
    "wrong_answer": "As you indicate, we will ultimately need to wait for the Supreme Court to weigh in on such a question, but some analysis of our own can lead to a reasonable understanding of the argument that might be made.  \n\nFirst, the only the thing that the Constitution actually says about the selection and voting of the state's electors is the following in Article II, Section 1, Clause 2:\n\n\n  Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof\n  may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of\n  Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the\n  Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an\n  Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed\n  an Elector.\n\n\nThe key point of this statement is that the electors shall be appointed in a manner the state's legislature deems fit, not by some national or Constitutional standard.  As a result, many of the types of laws you highlight are going to be given a fair bit of leniency from the Supreme Court.  In fact, almost all election law in the United States is state law and that is why we see elections being carried out so differently from state to state with the state's Secretary of State presiding over and certifying elections.\n",

    "question": "FactCheck.org considers Trumps claim that he inherited a broken CDC system to be 'misleading', and has given a long description of why they  made that ruling.  It effectively boils down to the claim that the CDC was never intended to be the sole producer of tests.  Instead they claim that the CDC was always intended to work with third parties and private sector to support the production of tests and other resources if a pandemic happened, and that the delays with testing was due to the CDC not allowing private sector agencies to build tests originally.\n\nIf it's true that the intent of the CDC was to support/regulate private sector test development, and that the CDC failed to do that, then the next question is why didn't it?  Why did the CDC not immediately open up production of tests to the private sector and support and vet those tests as factcheck.org claims was the original design intent?\n\nIs there a specific individual or group of individuals who had the ability to decide to open up testing to private sector and failed to do it?

    "wrong_answer": "There are two plausible explanations, the first being that they didn't want to contribute to further splitting the Remain-voting bloc, and the other being that they couldn't find a candidate in time.\n\nTo provide context to the situation alluded to in the question; originally the main Remain-supporting parties, the Greens, the Lib Dems, Renew, and Change UK had all planned to stand down their individual candidates and back an independent, pro-Remain candidate. This was decided on Tuesday the 7th of May, two days before the deadline to register candidates, to be Femi Oluwole. \n\nAfter wrestling with the decision on whether or not to stand for two days, Oluwole eventually decided not to run on the morning of the deadline. The reasons he gave for his refusal were fear of splitting the remain vote, handing victory to the Brexit party, lack of local ties to the area, inability to dedicate enough resources to the by-election while also working on the European elections, and ethical reasons related to his involvement in the Our Future Our Choice campaign which he co-founded. Oluwole threw his support behind the Labour candidate, who had not been involved with the talks to run a unity candidate, and indeed, as the link in the OP says, \"made it clear that they would strenuously disrupt the campaign and obstruct an independent candidate\".\n\nFaced with less than 24 hours to choose candidates to run before the May 9th deadline, it seems that Change UK either failed to find a candidate willing to stand for the party, or decided that running another pro-Remain candidate would help hand victory to the Brexit party by taking votes from the Labour candidate. Given that the candidate that they ended up supporting in the by-election, Renew's Peter Ward, eventually won just 45 votes, it seems likely that the party had found that their level of local support was negligible, and therefore that running a candidate would be wasteful, given the upcoming European elections. It is also possible, given that in April, Renew announced that they would support Change UK in the European elections, that there was some sort of private deal between the parties to trade support and pool resources.\n\nIn conclusion, then, it seems that while there is a lack of clarity surrounding this decision, and certainly no official explanation of their decision-making process besides wanting to avoid splitting the vote, by reading between the lines somewhat we can identify most of the factors that will most likely have influenced the decision.\n",

    "title": "Why is the lack of seasonal agricultural workers considered a problem given the high unemployment rate in every Western country?",
    "question": "Currently farmers in Western countries are warning governments that without foreign workers their fields will be impossible to harvest:\n\n\n  “We are in need of a lot of foreign workers,” Eystein Ruud, a greenhouse farm owner and chairman of the Norwegian Horticultural Association, told The Globe and Mail. “If we cannot get these workers in the coming weeks, our farmers won’t risk putting a lot of plants in the soil. That may affect the food supply.”\n\n\nAt the same time Western nations are about to face unprecedented levels of unemployment due to the COVID-related shutdowns. On the face of it, this seems like a perfect match - people who lost their jobs could now work their local fields, earning a salary and supplying much needed food for the nation. So why is this considered a problem, rather than a blessing in disguise? Shouldn't governments be happy they have job openings for the unemployed?\n\nI do understand that working the fields is difficult and only young people could do it, but currently a lot of young people lack a job too, so that looks like a manageable problem.\n",
    "answer_id": "52421",
    "answer": "I think these countries are in fact approaching this as a problem that has an obvious solution, as you suggest. The issue lies, however, with convincing their populace to work these seasonal jobs, and the inherent nature of seasonal agricultural work.\n\nFirstly, the levels of unemployment are not necessarily going to be as bad as you might think, at least in some countries. Many western countries, including Norway, which you mention, and later, the UK, have implemented schemes which will allow companies to keep employees who have been furloughed due to the crisis on the payroll by covering a large portion of their wages. These schemes don't stop claimants from taking another job, at least in the UK's case, but potentially reduce the need for them to do so.\n\nSecondly, the nature of this work means that for this to be a long-term job choice, workers need to be flexible and able to travel around the country. The BBC points out that \n\n\n  One reason overseas workers are recruited for these picking roles is\n  that farmers require temporary, flexible workers who will move around\n  the country following the crops.\n  It is often difficult for local people to fill these roles as they are\n  extremely busy for a short space of time - for example, two months to\n  pick apples - with no work for the rest of the year.\n\n\nSo while it might be easy to find workers in one area of the country, it is currently infeasible given the COVID-19 crisis for workers to travel around the country as previously. Therefore, a much larger number of local workers need to be found in order to meet with local demand, rather than smaller groups of seasonal workers meeting the demand nationally.\n\nAdditionally, western Europeans are unused to this sort of work. According to the Independent:\n\n\n  It's fair to say that British workers have turned their noses up at\n  seasonal farm work in recent years, perhaps partly due to the\n  availability of other, more secure jobs in more comfortable\n  surroundings.\n  \n  \"It's hard work and the Eastern Europeans are experienced at what they\n  do,\" says Oliver Shooter, owner of AE Lenton, which runs a group of\n  farms between Skegness and Boston in Lincolnshire, the centre of\n  England's vegetable production.\n  \n  \"It's not rocket science but it is quite a skilled job that these guys\n  do,\" he says. A top picker needs to know and apply supermarkets'\n  exacting standards for exactly how fruit and veg must look, as well as\n  how to cut it and pack it. For that they'll earn £12 an hour if\n  they're good. Many farms also provide free or subsidised\n  accommodation.\n\n\nThe seasonal workers that farms usually rely on, that know their trade and are experienced are unable to be used, so farmers are again being forced to engage a larger workforce than normal, in order to achieve a similar standard of work. This will, of course, entail higher costs, a longer training period, and presumably, a lower yield as mistakes are made.\n\nGovernments are trying to deal with this problem by pushing the solution you suggest - the Independent reports again:\n\n\n  So acute is the need that the government is reportedly readying its\n  own \"Pick for Britain\" campaign taking inspiration from the Land Army\n  that tilled the fields during the Second World War.\n\n\nIn Norway, the government has introduced a scheme which will encourage employees laid off by their employer to work in agricultural roles:\n\n\n  New legislation means that if a worker is laid off and takes up an\n  agricultural role, he or she will be able to earn both a salary from\n  the farmer as well as half his or her unemployment benefit.\n\n\nIt's not so much that the solution to the problem isn't obvious, it's that due to a combination of the nature of seasonal agricultural work, and the complications introduced by the current crisis, the problem is harder to solve than at first glance.\n",

The directive that I think is most relevant is Directive 89/656/EEC - use of personal protective equipment.\n\nThis directive sets minimum standards for PPE used by workers, and states the obligations that employers have on this matter:\n\n\n  Personal protective equipment must be used when the risks cannot be\n  avoided or sufficiently limited by technical means of collective\n  protection or procedures of work organization.\n  \n  All personal protective equipment must:\n  \n  \n  be appropriate for the risks involved, without itself leading to any increased risk\n  correspond to existing conditions at the workplace\n  take account of ergonomic requirements and the worker's state of health\n  fit the wearer correctly after any necessary adjustment.\n  \n  \n  The employer must provide the appropriate equipment free of charge and\n  must ensure that it is in good working order and hygienic condition.\n\n\nWhen defining what this directive covers, the following exceptions are noted:\n\n\n  The definition in paragraph 1 excludes:\n  \n  (a) ordinary working clothes and uniforms not specifically designed to\n  protect the safety and health of the worker;\n  \n  (b) equipment used by emergency and rescue services;\n  \n  (c) personal protective equipment worn or used by the military, the\n  police and other public order agencies;\n  \n  (d) personal protective equipment for means of road transport;\n  \n  (e) sports equipment;\n  \n  (f) self-defence or deterrent equipment;\n  \n  (g) portable devices for detecting and signalling risks and nuisances.\n\n\nNone of these exceptions would seem to cover medical workers except the rather non-specific \"emergency and rescue services\". I would take that to mean paramedics, ambulance staff, and mountain rescue workers and the like, however it is possible that this clause could be used to exempt general medical workers from this protection.\n\nSpecifically in the case of Romania, this directive has been implemented in national law by \"Hotărâre privind cerinţele minime de securitate şi sănătate pentru utilizarea de către lucrători a echipamentelor individuale de protecţie la locul de muncă\", or \"Decision concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the use by workers of personal protective equipment at the workplace\". From my rudimentary translation of the law, this appears to be pretty much word for word a translation of the original directive.\n\nAt first glance then, it seems that failing to provide adequate PPE for hospital staff is a breach of the employer's obligations under this EU directive. However, there are a number of exceptions noted in the directive, not to mention exceptions in national law, which could be used to exclude hospital workers from the protection. In addition, a few national governments have not implemented the directive into national law yet. This makes it difficult to give a definitive answer before this is tested in the courts, as a Spanish doctor's union is attempting.\n",

Rent may also be increased up to a point when a building is modernized.\n\nThe cap was implemented because the market didn't work for a lot of people who needed to spend more and more of their income on rent or be driven out of Berlin. The market also failed to build an adequate amount of new housing before the cap (fewer housing than needed for new residents were build, and the city actually build 25% of new housing itself). Experience has also shown that the market reacts to new buildings not with lower, but with increased rent. And despite the high need for affordable apartments, there was a high amount of vacancy. Because of this, the cap was very popular among voters (over 70% approval). \n",

    "question": "CONTEXT\n\nWhile no government wants there to be a pandemic, and would certainly prefer (hope) for it to just go away, they can only downplay it for a short time before it overwhelms the population and they must address it from a significantly weaker position than if they had acted decisively at the beginning.\n\nIn the smartphone era, information propagates instantly through informal networks (Facebook, WeChat, StackExchange, etc.) and is difficult to suppress.\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nAfter witnessing the COVID epidemic and failure to contain it in Asia, it spread to Europe and was poised to infect the west. Why did western hemisphere leaders downplay the pandemic’s threat instead of acknowledging the problem and communicating what would be done to reverse the issue?  What is the political incentive for deferring acknowledgement and action?\n",
    "answer_id": "52469",
    "answer": "In hindsight it's clear that many governments should have taken the risk of a Covid19 pandemic much more seriously, but it's not that easy to anticipate the reach and intensity of the epidemic before it happens. There have been other serious threats before for which the containment strategy proved sufficient, and if a government allocates resources (for instance massive purchases of masks and ventilators) which end up wasted they are going to be criticized as well. \n\nThis article in the Guardian argues that most European countries were not as well prepared as some Asian countries because:\n\n\nThere was no recent experience of a serious epidemic in the country,\ncausing leaders to subconsciously underestimate the seriousness of\nthe threat.\nThere is a potential political cost for a government if they invest\nresources by precaution and the risk doesn't materialize:\n\n\n  \"The challenge faced by government is whether and when to act on a health threat. If you act swiftly and the outbreak isn’t as bad as\n  feared, then government gets criticised for overreacting. If you\n  adopt a wait-and-see approach and move too slowly, then government\n  gets criticised for underreacting,\" says Steve Taylor, professor at\n  the University of British Columbia and author of The Psychology of\n  Pandemics.\n\n\nAs an example, during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic\nRoselyne Bachelot was Minister of Health in the French\ngovernment. She purchased 94 million vaccines, but only a small\nproportion turned out to be actually used. As a result she was\nwidely criticized for wasting public money. I assume that there are\nother examples of this kind, where a politician loses some political\npoints because they made a safe but costly decision.\n\n\nIt seems that when an epidemic threat presents itself a government must make a call between:\n\n\nTaking the threat seriously and therefore mobilizing important resources for an overall unlikely epidemic crisis, with a high risk to appear as overreacting and wasting public money.\nTaking minimal conservative measures, which is unlikely to be sufficient if the crisis materializes. However this will likely appear as the \"normal\" choice to make, since nobody could objectively have anticipated the intensity of the crisis.\n\n\nNote: this answer is made of recycled material from a closed question of mine.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "\n  Why do governments downplay or cover-up pandemics in their early stages?\n\n\nBecause most problems disappear over time, even when nothing is done.

COVID-19 is the exception to the rule.\n\nPoliticians who kick the can down the road, will barely ever be held responsible for past mistakes. If some decision turns out to be wrong many years later - a big if - the politician is already in some other role where people don't even know about that past mistake. While the current one responsible will just blame the predecessor. Everyone escapes responsibility in practice.\n\nAs a result, \"kicking the can down the road\" is a valid strategy for politicians. In fact, as almost all politicians at the higher levels act that way, it looks like it is requirement to survive the lower tiers.\n\nThe uniqueness of COVID-19 is the speed with which inactivity is exposed and punished.

    "title": "Is the correlation between the economy and US political outcomes weakening?",
    "question": "I have heard about the saying “It’s the economy stupid”, but I’m not sure about how true it is now. \n\nLet’s use Trump’s approval as an example. Even though there is a “rally around the flag effect” that is typical of leaders during crises (it is a lot smaller than governors and foreign leaders and especially President Bush in 2001), it does show that despite the stock market crashing, his approval continued to rise before presumably hitting a ceiling of about 46% on 538. For more context, in the years before, at 538, his approval was hovering at around 43% despite a relatively strong economy. \n\nI have read that the economy is not affecting people’s voting habits nearly as much as it used to. Is that true?\n",
    "answer_id": "52510",
    "answer": "Firstly, to address the example of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its effect on the popularity of Donald Trump; the level of correlation between the performance of the economy and US presidential popularity is well studied. For example, LSE research in 2013 found that presidential approval is highly sensitive to changes in the share index:\n\n\n  A positive change in the index, when controlling for other relevant\n  factors, on average produces an increase in the President’s approval. \n  Interestingly, the effect is even more pronounced when we look at\n  market acceleration or deceleration. When the market is growing at an\n  increasing rate, voters reward the president, but when growth is\n  decelerating, the president is punished.\n\n\nYou are right that President Trump's current opinion polls would seem to buck this trend, as the stock market has plummeted, with the Dow Jones crashing around 8000 points since the end of February, while the President enjoys record high approval ratings of 49% according to Gallup. However, I would argue that instead of an indication that these two measures are no longer intrinsically linked, they are rather an exception to the rule, precedent for which already exists.\n\nWe can, for example, consider the performance of the stock market in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, with the NYSE and the Nasdaq closing for almost a week, the Dow Jones falling 14%, and the NYSE market falling by 7.1%, a record at the time. Clearly in normal times, this would have led to a dramatic fall in presidential approval. However, as you note in your question, President Bush's approval rating soared to around 90%, the highest ever for a US president, and would go on to gradually lower over his tenure as President.\n\nAnother example might be the Gulf War in 1991. Although this took place in the middle of a recession, which had lowered the approval of President Bush Snr., his victory in the crisis gave him record approval ratings. This lead was, however, squandered over the next year, as Gallup puts it: \"Americans' attention shifted from the Persian Gulf to the struggling U.S. economy\". He would, of course, go on to lose the 1992 election to Bill Clinton.\n\nIt seems, therefore, that rather than this incongruency representing a break from the established conventional wisdom that presidential approval, and as a result, US political outcomes, mirrors the stock market, it is at least at the moment a reflection of previous examples of the 'rally around the flag' effect that you note in your question. Whether or not Trump's approval rating continues to stay at this high level will depend on how his response to the crisis is judged by the American public.\n\nSecondly, to evaluate the scope of your question more generally, there is a growing body of research which seems to support your notion that the aforementioned link between the performance of the economy and the electoral outcomes of incumbent politicians is becoming weaker, at least in the US. \n\nFor example, the NYT conducted a survey (notably before the current pandemic) weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States, in which public opinion regarding Trump's handling of the economy was tested. The full results can be found here. Their analysis suggests that:\n\n\n  Economic conditions have historically been among the best predictors\n  of presidential elections, and models based on those patterns suggest\n  that Mr. Trump would be favored to win re-election if the economy\n  remains more or less on its current path through Election Day. But it\n  is unclear whether historical lessons hold in an era of heightened\n  partisanship.\n\n\nIn particular, SurveyMonkey, who conducted the poll, note that\n\n\n  When asked which political party in general does a better job handling\n  the economy, the public is locked in a 45-45 deadlock. Republicans\n  overwhelmingly (95%) favor the Republican party, while Democrats\n  overwhelmingly (88%) favor the Democratic party. Independents are\n  split, with 39% favoring the Democrats and 36% favoring the\n  Republicans.\n\n\nIt would seem according to this research, that although \"Jobs and the economy\" remains the most important issue for the largest proportion (24%) of the survey participants, their other partisan beliefs are unlikely to shake their party loyalty in the wake of a change in economic fortunes.\n\nIn addition, 538 has a great article on this, which I won't go into too much detail on because this answer is already pretty long, but in particular, Silver notes that:\n\n\n  In particular, we don’t have enough data to make overly specific\n  claims about the economy. That is, any time you see what you might\n  call a “magic bullet” claim, such as that second-quarter GDP is\n  crucial or that per-capita disposable income is the key economic\n  variable, you should be wary.\n\n\nAlthough he also echoes the misgivings of the NYT article, that partisanship could dull the response to a recession, he maintains that the performance of the economy is still very important to the outcome for the incumbent party - \"The better off America is by November, the more likely he is to be re-elected.\"\n\nIn conclusion, then, although there is evidence to suggest that the conventional link between the economy and the fate of incumbent officials is weakening due to increased polarization and partisanship, the link is still undeniably extant. While in this specific case around the COVID-19 pandemic the incongruency can perhaps be explained by the 'rally 'round the flag' effect, it seems likely that the ultimate fate of Trump's 2020 campaign will be defined by his response to the pandemic and the underlying economical issues over the coming months. It is still far too early, in my opinion, to write off our conventional knowledge based on a few opinion polls conducted during a crisis.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "The state of the economy is a strong indicator for political outcomes because the economy is persistent in people's minds. Wars come and go, crises come and go, pandemics come and go, but the economy is always there in the background, and it's what people always return to worry about when more dramatic worries fade in their minds.\n\nTrump presents an unusual case in US politics for two (interconnected) reasons. First, and most obviously, Trump's entire political strategy is the creation of a continuous stream of mini-crises: endless insults, attacks, and divisive speech; sudden policy reversals or spontaneous 'gut' decisions that throw planning and preparation into disarray; bald-faced lies and misstatements that create conflict and distrust; etc. This has the effect of keeping the populace in a state of constant distracted agitation that makes that natural return to concerns about economic policy difficult. Combine this continuous agitation with Trump's patronizing and self-aggrandizing assertions that 'his' economy is the 'best ever', and that may be sufficient to mute the kinds of economic problems that ultimately sank W and HW Bush's approval rating.\n\nSecond — and this is a bit more abstract and philosophical — Trump is the titular leader of what Madison referred to as a 'faction' (see: Federalist #10), but a faction on a scale we have not yet encountered in US history. In Madison's words, a faction is:\n\n\n  [...] a number of citizens, whether amounting to\n  a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by\n  some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights\n  of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the\n  community.\n\n\nThis 'common impulse of passion' — which in the case of Trumpism I think of as neo-colonial exceptionalism: the idea that the 'perfect union' of the original colonists has been disrupted by 'outsiders' (brown people, Jews and Muslims, Leftists, feminists...) — is an overriding factor that (thus far) has kept Trump's approval rating from dropping below the mid-30's regardless of actual government outcomes. Whether that deep factional base will survive pandemic deaths and the collapse of the economy remains to be seen, but it is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe economy is still, and always will be, a significant factor in political life. At the end of the day, and after every crisis, people are going to worry about their mortgages, their social standing, the food on their table and the money in their bank accounts. That will never change. The political question, however, is whether and to what extent other supervening factors can be leveraged for political advantage over and above that economic given.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "The United States (US) only has two parties because of the way that presidential elections work.  In general, plurality voting systems lead to two parties.  You can read more about why at Duverger's law.  The basic idea is that plurality voting forces voters to choose which governing coalition should win the district before voting and the presidency is basically a national district.  \n\nIn other systems, voters have more ability to choose parties that represent them better.  In the US, they have to vote for atypical members of their parties, e.g. Blue Dog Democrats or Main Street Republicans.  In many other systems, those would be different parties.  The Congressional Black Caucus and Tea Party might also have been separate parties in other countries.  \n\nThe United Kingdom (UK) can have more than two parties because it is a parliamentary system (although still with plurality voting).  So while each district only has one or two serious parties, different districts can have different pairs.  Because the country as a whole has multiple parties, it is easier for the pairs to change in a district.  This helps avoid the stabilization into a two party system.  Note that it is still dominated by two parties.  Either Labour or the Tories are always in the governing coalition and have been since the demise of the Liberal party.  \n\nIn the last general election, the Tories used the promise of a referendum to keep the party from splitting into pro-Brexit and anti-Brexit factions.  One can view the pro-Brexit faction as having some similarity to the Tea Party movement in the US.  The Scottish National Party has some similarities to the Congressional Black Caucus.  It votes almost exclusively with Labour (vs. the Tories), but in the UK, it is a separate party rather than a Labour faction.  \n\nSince 1996, New Zealand has had a form of proportional representation.  Proportional representation encourages multiple parties as it is easier for small parties to get enough votes for representation.  People can choose a party that represents almost all of their beliefs.  The parties then choose a governing coalition that makes reasonable compromises.  Parties that don't support enough of the governing coalition's agenda join the opposition instead.  \n\nNew Zealand is not the only country with proportional representation.  It's actually rather common.  And in general, those countries have multiple parties in both the governing coalition and the opposition.  \n",

    "question": "As reported on the BBC today:\n\n\n  The [US] president accused the WHO of being \"very China-centric\" and said they \"really blew\" their pandemic response.\n  \n  Dr Tedros has now dismissed the comments, insisting: \"We are close to every nation, we are colour-blind.\"\n  \n  After first attacking the WHO on Tuesday, President Trump renewed his criticism at his press briefing on Wednesday, saying the organization must \"get its priorities right\". He said the US would conduct a study to decide whether the US would continue paying contributions [...]\n  \n  On Tuesday, President Trump had said the WHO appeared to be \"very biased toward China\".\n  \n  \"They called it wrong. They really - they missed the call,\" he said. \"And we're going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO. We're going to put a very powerful hold on it, and we're going to see.\"\n\n\nClearly (from the same article) Tedros has rejected the notion that the WHO has a China-bias, but have they said anything more specifically rejecting the other accusations, i.e. that they \"really blew\" their response and that they \"missed the call\" (when the pandemic started)?\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\n  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of Trump, vowed there would not be any funding for the WHO in the next Senate appropriations bill.\n  \n  \"I'm in charge of the appropriations subcommittee. I'm not going to support funding the WHO under its current leadership. They've been deceptive, they've been slow, and they've been Chinese apologists,\" Graham said in an interview with Fox News.\n  \n  Last week, Republican Senator Marco Rubio called for the resignation of WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, saying \"he allowed Beijing to use the WHO to mislead the global community\".\n\n\nThese latter accusations from Republican senators are even more direct and specific (than \"blew\"), accusing the WHO of deliberate deception, in cahoots with Beijing, besides being \"slow\".\n\nThanks to @ItalianPhilosophers for finding this, Fox News has been emphasizing this bit in their coverage of the Republican-WHO spat:\n\n\n  Last month, Taiwan accused the WHO of ignoring a warning it sent in December about human-to-human transmission of coronavirus. “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China,” the organization tweeted in January.\n\n\nWhich may be what the US Republicans are alluding to with \"slow\".\n\nSomewhat more obvious/predictible, Fox News is critical of the WHO's criticism of the US travel ban:\n\n\n  the WHO responded to Trump’s travel ban on foreign nationals coming from China by saying that “travel bans to affected areas or denial of entry to passengers coming from affected areas are usually not effective in preventing the importation” of coronavirus cases and instead could have a “have a significant economic and social impact.”\n  \n  Criticism of the travel ban and other pro-China statements have brought renewed questions about the U.S. funding the agency.\n\n\n(The latter issue has been the topic of two separate questions here e.g., so I don't want to reash that.)\n\nIf the WHO itself has not replied to those (other) allegations of Trump/Republicans/Fox-News/Taiwan more specifically, has the WHO's record in this respect been defended by others, e.g. has the press said anything in support/defence of WHO's actions in response to the pandemic that can address some of Trump's accusations (from those quotes that I have emphasized)?\n",

But I think overall their performance on this outbreak has been, not perfect, but pretty good,” Ashish Jha, a public health professor at Harvard, said.\n  \n  “They’ve been very transparent as much as they have known the data. They have had daily calls, they have been very clear about the severity of this illness, and how the global community has to respond.”\n  \n  Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Robert Redfield, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, took part in WHO conference calls about coronavirus from 7 January, according to sources familiar with the conversations.\n  \n  Gavin Yamey, the director of Duke University’s center for policy impact in global health, said: “If the United States had followed the WHO’s very clear advice on identifying cases, isolating cases and conducting contact tracing, then it wouldn’t be in the appalling situation that it is in today.”\n  \n  Despite its declaration, the WHO did not advocate travel restrictions of the sort imposed by Trump a day later on non-American travellers arriving from China. The president has pointed to this as an example of bad advice. But Gostin, who is director of the WHO centre on global health law, said that the organisation cannot generally call for travel bans under international law – and such bans can be counterproductive, leading countries to withhold vital information for fear of economic isolation.\n  \n  “To blame the WHO for acting on the basis of international law and science in ways that are entirely consistent with what WHO practices have been for decades is the height of hypocrisy,” he said.\n  \n  Trump claimed that his ban “shut down” intercontinental transmission of the virus, but an ABC television investigation found that there were 3,200 flights from China to the US in the critical period between December and March.\n\n\nThe Guardian article does grant the WHO critics some points on Taiwan:\n\n\n  The US president’s accusations that the WHO is “China-centric” have more resonance with public health scholars. The WHO has largely excluded Taiwan from its discussions, and dodged questions about the Taiwanese response, which has been one of the most effective. But because of pressure from Beijing – which sees Taiwan as an integral part of its territory and opposes any form of recognition – the blindspot is a UN-wide phenomenon.\n  \n  “I think the effusive praise for China, in the early days, was probably unnecessary,” Jha said.\n  \n  Amanda Glassman, the executive vice-president and senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, said a deeper problem is the WHO’s low budget and relatively toothless structure. Unlike the nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, it has no redress against governments that do not cooperate.\n  \n  “It operates in countries at the pleasure and permission of the host country governments. So in the case of China, to be allowed to enter China, it was a negotiation to get there,” Glassman said.\n\n",

    "wrong_answer": "When a candidate gets a majority in the first round, there is no difference. It is also usually possible to determine that all but the top two candidates did not win, even if it is not possible to immediately determine which of the top two candidates did win in IRV (although it is often possible to make a very good guess about that point based on the similarities and differences of the candidates who remain in the running to those who are eliminated).\n\nWhen no candidate receives a majority, as in Maine this year where the process was used for the first time, it took three or four extra weeks. But, some of this delay was because the process had to be implemented for the very first time in the history of that system being in place. It would probably be possible to shave a week or two off that time frame if the system were more familiar to election officials from prior use. If electronic voting systems, rather than paper ballots were used, it would have been possible to get the instant runoff result immediately, but that would come with downsides with regard to the degree to which the result could be audited.\n\nThis is several weeks shorter than a true runoff election in states like Louisiana and Georgia and California where that is held if no candidate wins a majority.\n\nOf course, races where no one candidate receives a majority aren't all that common, a fair number of close races are delayed for a week or two for a recount because the outcome was very close, WA state results are always delayed for a week or two since ballots can be postmarked on election day and received afterwards, and the cases that result in recounts in FPTP overlap somewhat with races in which no candidate receives a majority. So, the extent to which the process delays the last election result being finally decided is quite a bit shorter. Also, while most constituencies in the U.S. get a result that can be called on election night, a significant minority every year do not because vote counting precedes more quickly in some places than others, so even without significant delays, it almost always takes 2-3 days to get a final result. \n\nU.S. ballots take much longer than U.K. and Canadian ballots to count, in part, because U.S. ballots typically each include dozens of candidates and issues (from districts that do not have the same boundaries), and all of the constituencies in the U.K. and Canada are fairly small (and similar in size) compared to an entire U.S. state, a U.S. Congressional District, or a large U.S. county like Los Angeles (with 10.16 million people), while U.K. and Canadian ballots typically involve only a single candidate race on each ballot. Also, election administration in the U.S. is much more fragmented administratively with many more or less independent bodies handling this task.\n\nThe last election for Congress in the 2018 election that was decided, in NC where there was election fraud by Republican operatives in excess of the GOP margin of victory wasn't resolved in time for anyone from that seat to be elected by January 3, 2019 when everyone else was sworn in this year.\n\nThus, it is also important to distinguish between cases where the determination of which party received a majority of the legislative body are delayed v. cases where the determination of the exact extent to which the leading party or coalition has a majority is at stake. Unless the overall national outcome is almost perfectly 50-50, delays from counting non-majority races won't prevent the public from knowing which party will be in control of a body within 2-3 days.\n",

    "question": "A January 14 WHO tweet that has been widely re-broadcast months later by the right-wing US press (e.g. NYPost, WashExam but not exclusively by them, e.g. Bloomberg opinion piece, Politico o.p.) said that:\n\n\n  Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China.\n\n\nThe WHO is lampooned for this moment by the aforementioned media pieces, but these don't really say when the WHO came to a different conclusion regarding human-to-human transmission. So when did that happen, and what information source did the WHO use for the latter determination?\n",
    "answer_id": "52604",
    "answer": "The WHO was clearly wary that human-to-human transmission may be a factor at the beginning of January - although their initial Disease Outbreak News (DON) of January 5th entitled \"Pneumonia of unknown cause – China\" states that:\n\n\n  According to the authorities, some patients were operating dealers or\n  vendors in the Huanan Seafood market. Based on the preliminary\n  information from the Chinese investigation team, no evidence of\n  significant human-to-human transmission and no health care worker\n  infections have been reported.\n\n\nThey also note that all patients are being isolated, and that close contacts of patients are being identified and monitored, which indicates that this avenue was being investigated.\n\nFurther advice published on 10th January also indicated that:\n\n\n  From the currently available information, preliminary investigation\n  suggests that there is no significant human-to-human transmission, and\n  no infections among health care workers have occurred.\n\n\nBut again, warned that travellers should take measures such as\n\n\n  \n  avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections;\n  frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment;\n  travellers with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes\n  with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).\n  \n\n\nAccording to the WHO COVID-19 Timeline's entry for January 14th:\n\n\n  Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove noted in a press briefing there had been\n  limited human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus (in the 41\n  confirmed cases), mainly through family members, and that there was a\n  risk of a possible wider outbreak. Dr. Kerkhove noted that\n  human-to-human transmission would not be surprising given our\n  experience with SARS, MERS and other respiratory pathogens.\n\n\nAfter WHO officials from its China and Western Pacific regional offices conducted a brief field visit to Wuhan from the 20th-21st of Jan, the latter office published a twitter thread on January 21st stating that as a result of the increasing number of cases of the virus; \"It is now very clear [...] that there is at least some human-to-human transmission of #nCoV2019\". The thread also states that \"more information and analysis are needed on this new virus to understand the full extent of human-to-human transmission and other important details\". \n\nAdditionally, on the 21st of January, the DON for the spread of the disease in the Republic of Korea contained the phrase \"the extent of human-to-human transmission\", the first DON not to question the existence of human-to-human transmission, but rather its extent.\n\nA more formal announcement was made by the WHO mission to China on the 22nd of January which states that:\n\n\n  Data collected through detailed epidemiological investigation and\n  through the deployment of the new test kit nationally suggests that\n  human-to-human transmission is taking place in Wuhan. More analysis of\n  the epidemiological data is needed to understand the full extent of\n  human-to-human transmission. WHO stands ready to provide support to\n  China to conduct further detailed analysis.\n\n\nIn conclusion then, while human-to-human transmission was suspected to be present from the initial WHO DON on January 5th, this was not confirmed until after data observed in the field in Wuhan by members of the WHO China &amp; Western Pacific regional offices was thought to show that human-to-human transmission was clearly a factor. These field investigations took place on the 20th-21st of January, and announcements acknowledging this conclusion were first made on the 21st.\n",

    "title": "Why did some US institutions not migrate their very old software systems to use somewhat newer ones?",
    "question": "This article shows us that some US institutions rely on very old systems (written decades ago, which is very long in IT time perspective):\n\n\n  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy says that the state is looking for\n  volunteers with skills that can be used to help in the COVID-19\n  coronavirus outbreak, and one of those skills is knowing your way\n  around a 61-year-old programming language used on big, old, mainframe\n  computers. \n  \n  COBOL is an old computer programming language that was first developed\n  in the 1950′s in conjunction with the Department of Defense. Today,\n  most programmers prefer and use more modern languages, but there are\n  pockets where old software written in COBOL remains in use,\n  particularly financial applications and in large enterprises or\n  government agencies.\n\n\nI understand that state institutions are typically much slower that private companies when it comes to IT investments, but having such old systems seems strange. Relying on systems written so much time ago incurs lots of issues which translates to wasted time and money:\n\n\ninitial developments done way before modern software development frameworks were around us\nit is much harder to find specialists which know the language, but also are able to adapt to such an old software development style\ninability to act in a timely fashion when changes or maintenance must be performed (e.g. Coronavirus outbreak)\n\n\nIt makes for banks to be reluctant to rewriting their systems due to big costs and risks, since they must also make profit. But a public institution is not profit based and in theory can easier invest in modernizing their software systems.\n\nQuestion: Why did some US institutions not migrate their very old software systems to use somewhat newer ones?\n\nNote: I am not thinking about big leaps, but at least to work with languages and frameworks that are at most 20 years old, not 60 years old. \n\n\n\nWhile the main arguments are related to software development risks, I am interested in the political aspect of the \"why\", since we are talking about public institutions making the decision to partially / totally rewrite some systems. Such aspects might be related to the size of projects or quality of management in the public sector.\n",
    "answer_id": "52630",
    "answer": "It's not just US institutions, there are many countries, institutions - including banks - and companies running on ancient software and hardware.\n\nThere are multiple reasons for that:\n\nFirst, from the business standpoint, replacing software costs money. Why spend money to replace something that already meets requirements? If you have software A that does what you want, already exists and is \"free\", since you already own it, and software B, which doesn't exist yet, costs years of development time, probably requires new hardware and has the associated costs for all of that, which would your boss or your (often very much non-technical) boss\n's boss approve? What would a government employee with a tight budget approve? What would a politician calling for less government spending approve?\n\nSecondly, the exact workings of the system are often lost in time. No one actually knows what the system does exactly, but it interfaces with dozens of other systems through APIs that are equally unknown, obscure or deprecated. Creating a specification for such a system that a contractor/contracted company can work with is difficult, if not impossible. There is a huge risk that the resulting system will not replicate the behavior of the old system and stuff will stop working. It might do things like round .5 up instead of rounding to even like the old system, which could cause all the bills or transactions to suddenly be off by 1 cent compared to the previous system.\nIn government, a broken system could mean that the unemployed might not get their benefits, the tax payers not their yearly tax payback or any number of things that will lead to an elected politician not being reelected. Politicians like being reelected, so even if they understand the technical need, which is rare anyways, they might avoid the risks for political reasons. Often there were attempts at replacing the system, which then failed and then those failures get pointed at whenever someone proposes replacing the system.\n\nThirdly, the old systems usually have a very bad user interface. A new system will have a shiny, new interface, sometimes because creating the old interface wouldn't even be feasible in a new application. This requires training people. People that have worked in the company or institution for 40-50 years and are very set in their ways. Those people often have a lot of blocking power, which can completely halt development on the new system, because their requirements, i.e. \"don't change anything,\" aren't met. They are usually also very hard to fire and replace, so the institution has to hire new people without firing them, which requires a bigger budget, which comes back to the first point.\n\nIn summary, as technical people we might understand that those systems will someday inevitably go \"poof\" and everything will break down catastrophically. Other people either don't know that it can happen, or they just hope that it will happen after their time, because in the end no one wants to pay the money, take the risk and take the blame for a project that will probably fail.\n",

Both programs spent more than they received during the last recession.  Absent another recession, they might fund themselves through 2021.  The trust funds would be depleted entirely around 2034.  \n\nMedicaid does not have its own taxes, so it is always paid out of the general fund.  \n\nBy contrast, Defense, Veterans, and International Affairs are only 22%, less than either Social Security or health alone.  And Republicans tend to be of the opinion that Defense is underfunded.  \n\nThe other alternative is to increase taxes, and the Republicans are against increasing taxes.  Since spending is projected to grow, to keep the deficit constant, they have to \"cut\" spending.  Of course, in reality, spending on Social Security and Medicare will continue to rise regardless.  The \"cuts\" are really only slowing the rate of growth from its current projected amount.  \n\nWell, there is one other alternative.  They could increase the retirement age.  That both increases tax revenues from people working longer and decreases spending.  And it does so without increasing the tax rate.  That's essentially what the last bipartisan deficit commission recommended before Barack Obama rejected it.  \n\n\n  Do they want all three of these programs eliminated completely? \n\n\nPerhaps some do, but most want the programs to be self-funded out of the existing set-aside money.  There is currently no one recommending an absolute drop in spending in either Social Security or Medicare.  Both will increase every year under any plan actually proposed in Congress.  \n",

    "title": "How does libertarianism handle contagious diseases or pandemics?",
    "question": "In libertarianism, each person is responsible for their own health.  Nobody is forced to take health insurance, and a hospital is not obliged to provide care to an individual who cannot pay for the bill (either by themselves, via insurance, or hoping for donations).  If you break your leg and can't pay for treatment, you don't get treatment.\n\nHow does the inherently individualistic libertarianism deal with the inherently collective threat of a contagious disease, which may become an epidemic?  If a sick individual is not treated, they may infect hundreds of others.  Quarantining the sick individual against their will goes against individual freedom.  In theory one could argue they may be liable for the medical costs of everyone they infect, but that is not helpful when people don't know who infected them and the infected individual can't afford treatment for hundreds of others.\n\nMost countries deal with this threat by collectively paying for healthcare and drastically reducing the freedom of infected individuals, effectively putting them under house arrest or forcing them into hospital against their will.  Even the freedom of many healthy people is substantially reduced.  What alternatives does libertarianism propose to this, if any?\n",
    "answer_id": "52654",
    "answer": "While I haven't found a reference discussing the libertarian approach to pandemics more generally, I did find one about vaccines, which should be relevant enough, because it's another, related \"collective action problem\":\n\n\n  Libertarianism and collective action: is there a libertarian case for mandatory vaccination?\n  \n  In his paper ‘A libertarian case for mandatory vaccination’, Jason Brennan argues that even libertarians, who are very averse to coercive measures, should support mandatory vaccination to combat the harmful disease outbreaks that can be caused by non-vaccination. He argues that libertarians should accept the clean hands principle, which would justify mandatory vaccination. The principle states that there is a (sometimes enforceable) moral obligation not to participate in collectively harmful activities. Once libertarians accept the principle, they will be compelled to support mandatory vaccination. In my paper, I argue that the cases Brennan uses to justify this principle are disanalogous to the case of non-vaccination and that they are not compelling to libertarians. The cases Brennan offers can be explained by a libertarian using the individual sufficiency principle: which states that if an individual’s action is sufficient to cause harm, then there is a (sometimes enforceable) moral obligation not to carry out that action. I argue that this principle is more appropriate to Brennan’s examples, and more appealing to the libertarian, than the clean hands principle. In order to get libertarians to accept the clean hands principle, I present a modified version of one of Brennan’s cases that is analogous to the case of non-vaccination. Using this case, I argue that whether the clean hands principle will justify mandatory vaccination is dependent on whether the herd immunity rate in a given population is approaching a threshold after which a collective risk of harm will be imposed onto others.\n\n\nSo, one could say \"libertarians disagree\" [on the exact approach] to such matters based on that discussion. (And it would not be the only thing they disagree about.)\n\nActually, there is an article in the Telegraph that even says:\n\n\n  How can libertarians ever support mandatory quarantine and nationwide lockdowns? \n  \n  Quite easily, as it happens. I can’t speak for all libertarians (who can?) but I see libertarianism as applied economics. The government should leave businesses alone unless there are demonstrable market failures and it should leave people alone unless they are doing direct harm to others.\n  \n  In case it is not obvious, infecting somebody with a potentially fatal virus counts as direct harm to others....\n\n\nI haven't read the rest, but I'm guessing he's going to argue from externalities viewpoint... which according to other libertarians (Ryan Bourne of Cato in this case) is rapid descent on the slippery slope:\n\n\n  The classic recommended government remedy for this problem is to try to calculate the marginal external costs or benefits associated with a given activity (beyond the private costs or benefits) and implement taxes or subsidies so these externalities are priced in when consumption or production decisions are made. Joseph Stiglitz’s Nobel lecture is a good description of this policy solution.\n  \n  Given the pervasiveness of externalities, applying this logic consistently and universally would result in an extremely intrusive government.  [...]\n  \n  The logic of banning or adopting prohibitively high sin taxes, in contrast, is that the optimal consumption level of anything with external costs is zero. This is an absurd principle, albeit one that is regularly espoused. It is common, for example, to hear commentators and policymakers advocate for a zero-carbon economy. The UK government’s recent announcement that it plans to ban all gas and diesel vehicles by the year 2040 is an example of a policy that will almost certainly impose net social costs on society.\n\n\nSo yeah, from this latter \"more\" libertarian viewpoint, how do you account for the fact that infecting others is only a probability, not a certainty?\n\nAs an intermission, it would be interesting if the \"father\" of \"paleolibertarianism\" had something concrete to say on this ([the probability] of infection [of others]), but insofar I wasn't able to find out that, but only some imperfect analogies that he made:\n\n\n  Probably the most widely accepted doctrine within libertarianism is the “nonaggression” principle, which Rothbard uses as the central theme of his book. The “nonaggression” principle states that “no man or group of men may aggress against the person or\n  property of anyone else” (27). Thus, slavery was considered to be intrinsically evil because it\n  violated property rights, or the right of a person to be secure in themselves. Yelling “Fire!” in a\n  crowded theater, Rothbard argues, should not be restricted because free speech is only a relative\n  right; rather, it is criminal because it violates the private property rights of others in the theater\n  (52). Essentially, he ascribes to the belief that individuals have an absolute right to be secure in\n  their persons and goes on to apply it to numerous other aspects of life. Whether it be education,\n  roads, courts, foreign policy, or critiquing the ever-popular Keynesian theory of economics,\n  Rothbard consistently believes that the rights of the individual are incontrovertible. His beliefs\n  are best summed up as follows:\n  \n  \n    And, indeed, what is the State anyway but organized banditry? What is taxation but theft\n    on a gigantic, unchecked, scale? What is war but mass murder on a scale impossible by\n    private police forces? What is conscription but mass enslavement? Can anyone envision a private police force getting away with a tiny fraction of what States get away with, and\n    do habitually, year after year, century after century? (293-294)\n  \n  \n  This argument continues to be the bedrock of radical libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism, as it\n  provides a consistent philosophy that can be applied across all aspects of life. Moderate\n  libertarian thinkers tend to diverge from Rothbard, however, on the issue of how to implement\n  these ideals. Some, like Rothbard, want sweeping change and scoff at others who argue for\n  gradualism. Others, however, realize that government is needed in some limited capacity to\n  retain order and that the free market has limits.\n\n\nActually Lew Rockwell interprets Rothbard for us in the present context:\n\n\n  The fundamental rule for deciding whether anyone, including the government, is justified in using force to make us do something we don’t want to do is the nonaggression principle (NAP). As Murray put in in “War, Peace, and the State,” “No one may threaten or commit violence (‘aggress’) against another man’s person or property. Violence may be employed only against the man who commits such violence; that is, only defensively against the aggressive violence of another. In short, no violence may be employed against a nonaggressor.”\n  \n  You might at first think that you can use the NAP to justify forced quarantines against the coronavirus. Suppose someone had a deadly disease that would always spread to others if he came in contact with them. Probably the person would want to isolate himself and not infect others, but if he refused, wouldn’t the people in danger be justified in isolating him? He is a threat to others, even if he doesn’t intend to harm them. \n  \n  Thinking about this case can lead us astray, and here is where Murray can help us most. In his great book The Ethics of Liberty, he says, “It is important to insist, however, that the threat of aggression be palpable, immediate, and direct, in short, that it be embodied in the initiation of an overt act. Any remote or indirect criterion—any ‘risk’ or ‘threat’—is simply an excuse for invasive action by the supposed ‘defender’ against the alleged ‘threat.’” Murray hammers home the point later in the book. He says, “Once one can use force against someone because of his ‘risky’ activities, the sky is the limit, and there is virtually no limit to aggression against the rights of others. Once permit someone’s ‘fear’ of the ‘risky’ activities of others to lead to coercive action, then any tyranny becomes justified.”\n  \n  When we apply what Murray says to the coronavirus situation, we can answer our question about forced quarantines. People are not threatening others with immediate death by contagion. Rather, if you have the disease, you might pass it on to others. Or you might not. What happens if someone gets the disease is also uncertain.\n\n\nBourne (whom one might peg in the less \"paleo\" camp) also comments on the Covid-19 issue as well (on Apr 6):\n\n\n  the longer lockdowns go on, the more the income losses for businesses and households turn into bankruptcies and defaults, risking a depression. So economists recognise that the costs and benefits of policy will change over time. They will look for ways of maintaining low health risks but at lower economic and social cost than crude shutdowns, recognising this balance changes as the pandemic evolves.\n  \n  Indeed, once the transmission rate has been brought down and more people recover from the virus, the calculations could change drastically. If I were one of the last 50 people in the whole country to have not yet been infected, I would not expect a destructive national lockdown to protect me. So, clearly, there comes a point when it’s better to relax things from an economic welfare perspective. That could come much sooner than we think.\n\n\nInterestingly, it still considers a/the notion of welfare to society as a whole as relevant... but in view of how much [herd] immunity there is... which  actually is quite to the similar argument from the opening quote I gave in this answer. \n\nAnd it's easy to get sucked into the myriad variation of responses to Covid-19 of US libertarian writers/personalities/politicians (thus make this answer way too long), but I'll mention here anyway that Ron Paul (who ran for president on a Libertarian Party ticket at one point), has called (April 10) for Fauci to be fired because (according to Paul) Fauci infringed on American liberties by overestimating the number of potential deaths from Covid-19.\n\n\n  \"[...] they made these dire predictions so that they could go ahead and destroy peoples’ civil liberties and spend a lot of money and make up an excuse on why the stock market actually went down — all kinds of things by having this coronavirus event blown way out of proportion,” Mr. Paul said. “He should be fired,” Mr. Paul said about Dr. Fauci. [...]\n\n\nPersonality polemics aside, it seems that in most libertarian discourse the probability of infection (and death) needs to be considered, so it's not too different from how others approach the matter, but perhaps the probability is (subjectively?) \"tuned down\" at least in some US libertarian discourse. However, the most hardcore/paleo libertarians seem to reject that quantines could ever be justified.\n",

It does not cancel or revoke valid visas, though it temporarily prevents their use and may prevent the issuance of new visas in some cases.\n\nAdditionally, entering the US through land borders from Canada or Mexico is limited to \"essential travel\":\n\n\nUS citizens and permanent residents returning to the US\nTravel for medical purposes\nTravel to attend educational institutions\nTravel to work in the US\nTravel for emergency response and public health purposes\nLawful cross-border trade\nOfficial government or diplomatic travel\nUS armed forces and their family returning to the US\nMilitary-related travel\n\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nDoes this include only mainland China, or other territories as well? The 14-day rule does not apply the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau. It does apply to the disputed province of Tibet. It does not apply to Taiwan, the Republic of China, which is claimed by the People's Republic of China but is not functionally a part of that country.\n\nDoes this include British territories as well? The proclamation covering the UK excludes \"overseas territories outside of Europe\". This seems to mean that Gibraltar and the Crown Dependencies are included, but other British territories are excluded.\n\nDo the US-Canada and US-Mexico border restrictions apply to air travel? Not at this time.\n\nWhen do these restrictions take effect?\n\n\nFor China: February 2, 2020 at 5:00pm EST\nFor Iran: March 2, 2020 at 5:00pm EST\nFor the Schengen Area: March 13, 2020 at 11:59pm EDT.\nFor the Common Travel Area: March 16, 2020 at 11:59pm EDT.\nLand border restrictions: March 20, 2020 at 11:59pm EDT.\n\n\nWhere are these regulations found? The Department of Homeland Security has a page on air travel restrictions, a fact sheet, and a list of news and updates. The CDC has a page on procedures for travelers from the affected countries.\n\nThe recent extension of restrictions to the Common Travel Area, consisting of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, was announced by US Vice President Pence at a press conference Saturday the 14th. Official regulations have yet to be promulgated.\n\nRegulations on flights arriving in the US needing to be redirected to certain airports, published in the Federal Register:\n\n\nFor China: this document, with additional airports provided in this document\nFor Iran: this document\nFor the Schengen Area: this document with additional airports\nFor the UK and Ireland: this document\n\n\nThe Presidential Proclamations banning entry of certain sub-classes of these individuals:\n\n\nFor China: here\nFor Iran: here\nFor the Schengen Area: here\nFor the UK and Ireland: here\n\n\nDHS has announcements for the US-Canada and US-Mexico land border restrictions, and the rules can be found in the Federal Register:\n\n\nFor US-Canada land border: this document\nFor US-Mexico land border: this document\n\n\nHow long will these restrictions last? The restrictions will remain in effect until further notice from the government. With respect to the entry ban specifically, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is to advise the President at least every 15 days whether or not the ban should be changed or cancelled. The land border restrictions last until April 20, 11:59pm EDT.\n\nWho made this decision, why, and what is there authority to do so? The Secretary of Homeland Security made the decision to impose new travel restrictions. The Secretary has the legal authority to designate the places at which flights inbound to the US may land for inspection. The Secretary decided that this measure was necessary to prevent serious harm to the national security.\n\nThe President has the authority to suspend the entry of aliens into the US as needed for national security. President Trump found that the federal government is incapable of monitoring all of the 14,000 daily travels between China and the US. Therefore, this rule is needed to protect the public health and safety of America.\n\nThe CDC has authority to enact quarantines under the Public Health Service Act.\n\nWhat if I do not comply with these rules? If you lie to officials about your presence in China to avoid the regulations, you could face serious immigration consequences including expedited removal from the country and a permanent inadmissibility in the future. If you attempt to escape quarantine, the government may use lawful force to prevent you from doing so.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "I used to travel to Brittany every summer, and before having a child in school we'd usually go in late June or early July. You normally get summer weather, but avoid the hordes of children. It's a popular destination for British families so it's worth avoiding the British school holidays as well, and even the Dutch ones. The downsides are: the sea temperatures are still a little low, (not an issue if you're not going in the water); not everything is open. \n\nJust after the school holidays, in September, it's also quiet (maybe not the first week). Again some places are closed, such as restaurants taking a holiday, but the sea will be warmer. I've had good weather then too, but probably more rain. As you get into autumn the chance of rain increases, though the storms you worry about are fairly rare all year round (and dramatic if you find the right cliff-top spot to watch them).\n",

    "title": "KLM canceled a flight from China back to Europe that we had already requested a refund for. Are we entitled to compensation or just refund?",
    "question": "Due to the coronavirus KLM canceled all flights from China about a week ago. Naturally we are entitled to a full refund. According to European Union air passenger rights, passengers are also entitled to up to €600 Of compensation in the case of a canceled flight. However, we requested a cancellation of our tickets five days before they announced the cancellation of our flight but after it became public that China closed down Wuhan with the risk of other cities. So we wanted to leave as early as we could. KLM had given notice that they offer rebookings and cancellations at that time. \n\nAre we therefore also entitled to a 600€ refund Or would we have had to first give KLM the chance to offer us an earlier flight before booking a flight with another airline and canceling theirs? Or should we have waited 5 days until they cancelled the flight to be entitled to receive both the refund + compensation?\n\nSo in short, what does the compensation depend on? Also, does the corona virus qualify for the airline to waive the compensation penalty because it’s an “extraordinary circumstance” in the legal sense?\n\nEdit: the cancellation &amp; approval of the refund claim of my ticket came into effect yesterday, 5 days after the flight would have taken place. We received no confirmation of cancellation neither for our specific request nor any warning of the airline itself that the flight was cancelled in general. This suggests that they A cancelled our tickets and therefore B didn’t consider us a passenger anymore at the time of cancellation. Still, it’s odd that they never gave us confirmation of the ticket cancellation. Just a “pending approval for refund request” state. \n",
    "answer_id": "153453",
    "answer": "The airline did NOT cancel your flight.  They cancelled a flight that you were not booked on at the time of the cancellation.  It is as simple as this.  You were not booked on the flight, so you are due no compensation.\n\nIF you had not already canceled your tickets, and you were still booked on the flight at the time of the cancellation, then you might have been due compensation under EU261, but it's very likely that the airline would consider an epidemic to be \"extraordinary circumstances\" which removes the need for the airline to provide compensation.\n\nAddition to address the update to the question :\nSimplistically speaking, airline bookings have two parts - a \"reservation\" which covers the booking on specific flight segments on specific days, and a \"ticket\" which basically shows that you have paid for those flights.  When you book a flight, first a reservation is created, then you pay, and then a ticket is issued.\n\nWhen you cancel flights, the reservation of those flights is cancelled.  At that point, you are no longer booked on those flights, although you still potentially hold a ticket.  This will happen immediately that you ask for the flights to be cancelled, as the airline wants to be able to free up the seats so they can sell them to someone else.  No refund will be made as a part of cancelling a reservation.\n\nAt this point, you hold a ticket that states you've paid $X for, but which contains no flight segments as they have been cancelled.  Depending on the airline, the actual ticket you purchased, and any special conditions the airline might allow (such as allowing refunds during an event like an epidemic even if the ticket doesn't normally allow refunds), the value on that ticket might be lost entirely, might be only able to be used to book a future flight, or might allow a refund.\n\nIn order to actually get the refund, whoever issued the ticket (which might be the airline you were flying, another airline, or a travel agency) will need to cancel it and process the refund back to you.  This is a separate step in the process, and it could happen hours, days, or even months after the reservation was cancelled.\n\nHowever none of that changes the fact that once the reservation has been updated, you were no longer booked on that flight, and thus no longer due compensation.\n",

I would suggest reaching out to whoever you purchased your ticket from (either Emirates or the travel agent) and asking them to arrange an alternative. It is possible they will contact you, but the earlier you arrange the alternative the better the options may be.\n\nDepending on how much notice you were given of this change and how much you need to change your arrival time, you may be able to claim compensation under EU261.\n",

They will definitely not care about a laptop, accessories, or a graphics card.\n\nIf you enter or exit the EU (or travel between non-EU countries), in theory, they could force you to pay tax and duty on everything you carry beyond your personal allowance (usually around a few hundred euros), and you could then reclaim those when exiting again. In theory, you should use an ATA Carnet to avoid paying tax and duty.\n\nIn practice, in most countries (there are exceptions), they really don't care about all the stuff they know you'll bring back home when you leave. What is an issue to them is anything that will remain in the country. If your laptop, accessories, graphics card and whatnot look like you actually use them, they probably won't bat an eyelid. It would be different if you had a brand new laptop still in original shrinkwrapped packaging.\n\nI think you confused security checks and customs in your question, but if it was indeed customs and not security that asked you to turn your laptop on, it was more probably to check that it was actually used (i.e. not waking up to the initial setup screens, but with an account created, applications installed, files present...).\n\nAs long as you can show them what you use the card for, I don't quite anticipate an issue.\n\nIf you really want to be on the safe side, get an ATA Carnet.

Due to age and other factors, including the proximity to the newer Brooklyn Bridge station, it was put out of commission in 1945. It is now open to the public to see, but only on guided tours provided by the New York Transit Museum. The tours take about two hours, and start at the new Brooklyn Bridge station, which is approximately 600 feet away.\n\nThat paragraph is from the New York Transit Museum website. The first sentence refers only to the tour of the Old City Hall Station, and the other also includes things happening in and around the museum itself. (It's a little bit confusing, though, so it could be a good idea to give them a call in case you can book a tour now.)\n\nIn order to take the tour of Old City Hall Station, you must be a member of the New York Transit Museum. Note that the tour costs $50 in addition to the membership fee. \n\nThere are some strict rules you must follow, including:\n\n\n  To be admitted to these restricted sites, participants must provide a copy of a government-issued ID for a background check, and must sign a release immediately after purchasing tickets. If you do not submit your signed release form and copy of a government-issued photo ID by the stated deadline you will not be permitted on the tour and you will not receive a refund.\n\n\nThe tours are sold out as soon as the tickets go on sale, usually within the first hour!\n\nYou usually need to wait until a designated time in order to get your tickets, which are released in blocks. Members receive an email newsletter three times a year, announcing the release of tickets for the coming few months. May through August tours become available in April. This means you may still be able to book a July tour if you check the website as soon as they go on sale! Tickets are sometimes made available during other times, but it's hard to know when those will be. \n\n\n  Watch our email newsletter for new tour dates. We schedule a block of tours and release tickets three times a year, usually in April (for tours taking place May – August), August (for tours taking place September – December), and December (for tours taking place January – April). If you’ve just joined and see that tours are sold out, there will be more chances to buy tickets during your year of membership.  \n  \n  Sign in to buy tickets when they go on sale. Tours tend to sell out very fast that morning, often within the first hour! Tickets cost $50 per person. Here are answers to some other frequently asked questions about buying members’ tickets..\n  Source.\n\n\nThis site has a description and pictures taken by someone during the tour  \n\nMuseum membership allows you and your family to do other fun things in and connected with the museum. For instance, there are Trivia Nights; Discovery rooms for play and education; Train Operator's workshops; access to other historic sites, just to name a few. Some are free with membership. For others, there's a fee, often around $15 or $20 dollars. They can enhance your trip, and help you get the most value from your membership fee. A program list is here. Search by date and see what's going on during that July week. I found a program that takes place on July 27, and I'm sure there are others. \n\nIf you get a chance to go, come back and let us know if it was fun! \n",

    "question": "I need to cancel or possibly change an international flight on United with a non-refundable ticket (class T). When I log in to the app and hit cancel, the credit shown is the exact amount I paid for the ticket - $953. Within the credit box, it says \"change fees may apply,\" but doesn't show any sort of deduction.

    "answer_id": "154433",
    "answer": "United Airlines uses a \"New Money\" concept for change fees.\n\nBasically this means that you can cancel your flight at this time and receive a $953 credit voucher.  However in order to use that voucher at a later stage you will need to pay $400 \"new money\" (ie, the $400 can't come out of the voucher value), and then you'll be able to use the full $953 value of the credit.\n\nDepending on when the trip is, you may want to wait until it's a little closer to the date to see if they add Rome to their waiver list for areas affected by the Coronavirus. If they do that you will likely be able to (at least) avoid paying the change fee.  The refund amount/change fee won't change over time, so as long as you cancel at least a day or two before the flight there's no reason not to wait.\n",

    "answer": "From what I can find of official information, the Czech Republic has suspended the processing of visa applications and issuance of visa at the embassy in Beijing and the consulates in China (Shanghai, Chengdu) and Hong Kong. It is worth to notice that this restriction affects also non-chinese residents of China, who are now also not able to apply for a visa.\n\nSome media have indeed reported that the visa ban applies to all Chinese citizens, but there is no official information supporting that and I believe these reports to be mistakes. It seems very well possible for Chinese citizens who are resident outside China to get a Czech visa from the consulates at their place of residence and there seem to be no ban for residents of China to enter the Czech Republic if they are already in posession of a visa.\n\nUnless the Czech Republic is the main destination in the Schengen area, it should also still be possible for Chinese residents to obtain a Schengen visa from other consulates and then use that visa for travel to the Czech Republic. It will probably have little impact on actual travel patterns for a single Schengen country to impose restrictions as have been done here.\n",

    "question": "I am travelling to Bangkok and just got to know that I will be flying on a  22 year old Thai Airways Boeing 777-200, how safe is it to fly on a plane this old?\n\n\n",
    "answer_id": "154653",
    "answer": "I think the myth here is that an older aircraft isn't safer because of wear and tear. That's not really true due to maintenance requirements. If you want to, you could fly in a Douglas DC-3 (1930s aircraft) today if you had enough time and money to find the operator. Any aircraft can be operated if it is still maintained.\n\nThe reason aircraft get retired from commercial airlines is generally they become expensive to maintain, not because they stopped being airworthy. Airlines don't buy one airplane, they buy a fleet, which includes the maintenance portion. The larger picture there is you need\n\n\nTrained pilots\nMechanics to repair them\nAvailable parts\n\n\nIt's #3 that will eventually drive an aircraft out of general use. Delta, which flies the MD-80/88/90 series, is set to retire the aircraft in 2022.\n\n\n  Delta will remove the MD-90 two-years earlier than previous plans to “realize fleet simplification benefits,” said Jacobson during the airline’s second quarter earnings call on July 11. The airline will replace the aircraft with ones from its current orderbook, which includes 77 Airbus A220s(sic, likely A320) and 144 Airbus A321s and A321neos, he added.\n  \n  The early retirement of some MD-90s was understood to be to support the in-service fleet, with parts from the removed aircraft available to support operational aircraft.\n\n\nIn other words, Delta cannibalized some of its fleet for parts, and may be actively doing so with its rolling retirement. McDonnell-Douglass (who made the planes) is now owned by Boeing, and production of the MD-90 ceased in 2000. These planes can still be flown after Delta retires them, but Delta will have a hard time (i.e. expensive) sourcing new parts, which makes less sense for an active carrier airline operating thousands of aircraft around the world. Other aircraft of similar size are in production and their parts are more plentiful.\n\nThe planes will be sold to secondary carriers. You might have seen one in the news recently, when the US government chartered a flight with Kalitta Air (likely operating a 747-400) to evacuate US citizens exposed to the coronavirus. These companies operate smaller fleets and, since they get cheaper used aircraft, the increased cost of finding parts will be offset.\n\nTL;DR\n\nThe Boeing 777 is still in production. It is as safe as any aircraft in commercial airline use, regardless of age.\n",
    "answer_type": "Accepted",
    "wrong_answer": "Yes good maintenance practices and regular overhauls by the aircrafts operator reduce the chances of an accident but in my opinion the chances of a component failure do to metal fatigue increases with the age of the aircraft, This is because every time an aircraft is pressurised, lands and takes off significant forces act on all the structural components. Unless the aircraft is completely dismantled, NDT'd (non distructive testing) some small stress fractures can go undescovered.\nAlso newer aircraft have better, stronger and more resilient materials of manufacture.\nTherefore you are more likely to have an incident on an older aircraft compared to a newer aircraft. \n",

    "question": "My BF flies on Monday Athens-Zurich-Miami, with Swiss. He recently received an email saying that his flight details have changed, and he finds out that Lufthansa, ATH-ZRH operator, will most likely cancel the flight due to the COVID-19 coronavirus. The other flight is scheduled.\n\nHe went to the airport, but the booth told him that they assist only with today's flights, and gave him the central contact number. He calls, but fails getting through, most likely because of the heavy load of calls these days... He'll email them too, but with weekend ahead, it'll probably go without an on time response.\n\nAny ideas on what'd be his next realistic steps? He's really stressed!\n",
    "answer_id": "154695",
    "answer": "He shouldn't get stressed too much. Lufthansa/Swiss are rearranging their schedule a bit, due to decreased demand. And yes, this will mean that some flights are cancelled. That does not mean that all flights are cancelled or that they won't take him at all. \n\nHe has a ticket with Swiss, and they have to transport him to his destination, even if on a different flight. He does not have to worry about being \"left behind\" if he doesn't make his first flight.\n\nIs the flight cancelled?\n\nCurrently, he does not know. He can (and should) check the flight status online (Swiss timetable and Lufthansa Flight Status).\n\nAs long as the flight isn't officially cancelled, it makes little sense to call or go to the airport - they can't tell you much. Also, it makes little sense to re-book if you don't know which flights are going to operate.\n\nWhat happens if it is cancelled?\n\nIf the flight is cancelled, the airline will offer to re-book him on a different one: There are multiple flights from Athens to Zurich, but they could rebook him completely (e.g. going through Frankfurt on Lufthansa). If isn't happy with the new itinerary, they will usually offer other options. He could also get a refund, but it seems like he wants to travel.\n\nIf he booked it through a third party (e.g. Expedia), he'll have to go through them for any re-booking.\n\nIf the flight isn't cancelled, he should be at the airport early so that he can directly talk to the agents in case of a last-minute cancellation.\n\nOther things\n\nOn their information page Swiss currently informs passengers that they can freely re-book all tickets bought before March 5th. (However, it seems like your BF wants to travel).\n\nIn case of a delay or cancellation your BF may also have a right to compensation under the EU rules - at least in this case, when the outbreak directly the reason for the cancellation.\n",

    "title": "Airfare refunds for coronavirus",
    "question": "Has anyone had success getting airlines to issue refunds, or at least extend the value of unused tickets, for upcoming travel that had been booked long before the COVID-19 outbreak?  \n\nMy question specifically concerns United Airlines and non-refundable tickets to destinations that are not otherwise covered by any explicit guidance.  I'd be interested in hearing about others though.\n\nIt seems like airlines are offering flexibility for new travel bookings but not ones made a while back.  And travel insurance will only cover you if your travel is individually impacted due to illness or quarantine.  \n",
    "answer_id": "154768",
    "answer": "Your question is very generic, so I answer in general:\n\nIn general if a government (or an airline) doesn't stop travellers or planes, you will have no direct refund. It means that both think that there is no danger.\n\nSo usually it is recommended to have a travel insurance (for important/expensive travel, like far away for holidays). On the other hand, also a travel insurance may not allow you to cancel: it depends on the kind of insurance you get: some (the more expensive) doesn't ask reasons, other are more restrictive (and again, if you are not in a risk category, and there is no recommendation from government) they will not refund you.\n\nOn the other hand, this is a special (and global) thing, so to get good news coverage, they may end to refund you. Cruise lines are starting this (also for old bookings), let's hope also the airlines will follow.\n\nThe reason about having such rules for new booking: they are trying to convince new people to book. Without such incentives, many passengers will not book (and after booking many will travel anyway), this will keep cashflow. Old booking: they have already paid, so if they do something, it is just to get good publicity.\n\nBecause the airlines will reduce flights, you may hope that they will effect your flight, so that you can cancel/rebook (or having credit for next flight).\n",

    "answer_id": "154868",
    "answer": "Update 12/03/20: The USA is now refusing entry to anyone coming from Europe, for 30 days. So you won't even make it to Atlanta. \n\n\n\nAccording to the link to the embassy you provided you will be denied entry to Jamaica. This will most likely already be executed by KLM staff in Frankfurt. This means you will be denied boarding in the first place.\n\nThe only exception would be if you are (also) a Jamaican citizen.\nYou did not mention when you are flying, so if your flight is only going to be in a few weeks or even days, the situation might have changed completely. Then you just have to wait and go an a day-by-day basis and see what the embassy has to say.\n\nAs per your suggestion that you could still only travel to Atlanta, I suggest you search for \"skipping one leg of a journey\" here on this site. This usually always turns out bad (especially for a possible return flight which will be cancelled by the airline). Since in the US you always have to check your bags again on an international transfer, you could get your bags at least and given the right Esta/Visa for the US you could leave the airport and wait two weeks there. Two weeks would be the minimum period you'd have to wait before being allowed entry into Jamaica. You would then have to buy a new ticket to Jamaica, of course and your return flight would have been cancelled and you would have to buy that one again, too.\n\nWith all this said, it might be best to call the airline (Delta in this case, since you booked with them) and see if they can give you a (full) refund.\n",

    "question": "A friend of mine is currently in Cuba and was due to return to the UK on 2 April travelling Holguin> Montreal with Air Canada, and onwards to London Gatwick with BA (single PNR, booking made direct via the Air Canada website).\n\nYesterday she received an email cancelling her flight but without giving any alternative. Long-distance communication from Cuba can be difficult, so far she has been unable to contact the airline to find out if they will re-book her on an earlier flight.\n\nI have tried to help her from the UK, but the ‘manage my booking’ option just directs me to a toll free number that doesn’t connect. I tried calling their Customer Services number in Canada but, unsurprisingly I suppose, could not get through.\n\nFWIW, she is a UK citizen married to a Cuban citizen/resident but will need to try to extend her 60 day visitor visa (usually the maximum allowed) if she is trapped in Cuba. She is a 15 hour bus journey away from Havana and if possible needs to depart from Holguin. Only a few airlines fly into Holguin, the only realistic alternative would be Condor via Frankfurt, then Lufthansa to UK.\n\nTo date I don’t recall seeing many questions about Air Canada and flight cancellations. I am aware that they are offering a flexible change policy right now. \n\nMy question is: \n\n\nhas anyone else been in this situation with Air Canada since the COVID-19 emergency erupted? Given that her cancelled flight was more than 48 hours away, can we expect Air Canada to email her again in the next couple of days with information about an alternative flight?

    "title": "UK Standard Visitor Visa implications during travel restrictions as a result of COVID-19 outbreak?",
    "question": "My wife (a Kazakh national) is visiting in the UK on a Standard Visitor Visa, staying with my family. She arrived on Feb 1st. Her original intention was to stay for approximately 3 months, until April 30th, and stated as such on her application form. She had been to the UK twice already, and had always departed in line with her intentions as originally stated during her previous applications. Her current visa expires in July.  \n\nDue to the COVID-19 outbreak, Kazahkstan will institute a one-month travel ban from tonight, preventing flights into the country. I'm a little concerned about what should happen if the ban is extended beyond that. \n\nI understand that the Home Office generally frowns upon visitors who stay longer than their stated intentions, even if they do not overstay their visa lengths. But if the Kazakh travel ban prevents her from travelling back to her country until a date beyond April 30th, might this cause a problem in her future visa applications? Or is it a reasonable excuse, and provided she explains the extended duration of her previous stay during the future application, might it be okay? \n\nEdit: On that note, she applied for this UK visa from China (where we lived at the time). Obviously, returning to China at this point, while theoretically possible (though we'd have to apply for new Chinese visas; they expired in February, a fact that she readily disclosed in her application), is hardly desirable. This is a circumstance that we could hardly have predicted beforehand. Her Chinese visa was temporary and she acknowledged this fact during her application. Might the UK officials think \"well, you couldn't fly to Kazakhstan, sure, but why not go back to China? After all, you applied from there\" ? I must stress that she never stated during her application that she intended to go back to China; indeed our plan was always for her to fly to Kazakhstan around April 30th, the original envisaged date of departure. Am I overthinking this, and would the specific country that she'd go to after departing the UK be of no concern to them whatsoever? \n",

    "question": "I booked an easyJet flight from London to Zurich several months ago. I also have an annual Coverwise travel insurance policy. I am a Swiss citizen but resident in the UK. \n\nI was scheduled to return back on the 23rd of March but easyJet has cancelled that flight. I am able to get a refund or change my flight date on easyJet but the next available date is not clear and looks like it will be after the 23rd.\n\nIs there any compensation for the extra expenses of hotels (not yet booked) and subsistence for the extra days in Switzerland from either the airline or the travel insurance?\n",
    "answer_id": "155134",
    "answer": "I assume you have already travelled London - Zurich, and it is your return which has been cancelled, stranding you in Switzerland.\n\nWhilst Switzerland is not in the EU, it is a signatory to EC261/2004. Thus cancellation of a departure from Zurich is covered by that regulation. \n\nSince these are extraordinary circumstances, you will be unlikely to receive the usual levels of compensation for a cancellation within 14 days of scheduled departure. \n\nHowever, this is distinct from the duty of care provisions. Provided you have not opted for refund on your cancelled flight, then guidance issued just yesterday confirms that this still applies, despite (or arguably, because of) a potentially lengthy stay: \n\n\n  According to Article 9 of the Regulation, which provides all relevant details, passengers\n  who are affected by a flight cancellation must also be offered care by the operating air\n  carrier, free of charge. This consists of meals and refreshments in a reasonable relation to\n  the waiting time; hotel accommodation if necessary, and transport to the place of\n  accommodation. Moreover, airports are to provide assistance to disabled passengers and\n  passengers with reduced mobility in accordance with Regulation 1107/20069\n  .\n  \n  It is worth recalling that when the passenger opts for reimbursement of the full cost of the\n  ticket, the right to care ends. The same happens when the passenger chooses re-routing at\n  a later date at the passenger's convenience (Article 5(1)(b) in conjunction with Article\n  8(1)(c)).\n  \n  The right to care subsists only as long as passengers have to wait for a rerouting at the\n  earliest convenience (Article 5(1)(b) in conjunction with Article 8(1)(b)).\n  \n  The intention underlying the Regulation is that the needs of passengers waiting for their\n  return flight or re-routing are adequately addressed. The extent of adequate care will have\n  to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the needs of passengers in the\n  circumstances and the principle of proportionality (i.e.: according to the waiting time).\n  The price paid for the ticket or the length of the inconvenience suffered should not\n  interfere with the right to care (Interpretative Guidelines Point 4.3.2).\n  \n  According to the Regulation, the air carrier is obliged to fulfil the obligation of care even\n  when the cancellation of a flight is caused by extraordinary circumstances, that is to say\n  circumstances that could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been\n  taken.\n  \n  The Regulation contains nothing that recognises a separate category of 'particularly\n  extraordinary' events, beyond the 'extraordinary circumstances' referred to in Article 5(3)\n  of the Regulation. The air carrier is therefore not exempted from all of its obligations,\n  including those under Article 9 of the Regulation, even during a long period. Passengers\n  are especially vulnerable in such circumstances and events.10 In exceptional events, the\n  intention of the Regulation is to ensure that adequate care is provided in particular to\n  passengers waiting for re-routing under Article 8(1)(b) of the Regulation.\n\n\n(from Commission Notice -Interpretative Guidelines on EU passenger rights regulations in the context of the developing situation with Covid-19, section 3.3.)\n",

    "wrong_answer": "I recall seeing Gayot Fow claim that this was possible, which one does not contradict lightly. On the other hand the \"conventional wisdom\" is that a Schengen consulate would probably refuse to examine a visa application from an Annex II national. And the Schengen rules I can find do not clearly seem to contemplate that possibility.\n\nThe rules context is quite different. A third-country national wishing to enter the UK needs to have either an \"entry clearance\" (applied for in advance) or \"leave to enter\" (granted by the immigration officer at the border). So having an entry clearance does, in principle, mean that you don't need to convince the IO to take the positive step of issuing a leave-to-enter, just that he should honor the entry clearance you already have.\n\nIn contrast the Schengen Borders Code states that all third-country nationals go through the same \"thorough check\", described in Article 8, subsection 3(a). Verification of a visa for Annex I nationals is in addition to that common procedure. At least as far as the EU legislation goes.\n\nNeither does the Schengen Handbook for the processing of visa applications mention anything (in either direction) about visas for Annex II nationals.\n\nThis does not conclusively prove that there can't be an administrative practice of issuing visas to Annex II nationals who bother (and pay) to apply for one. But such a practice could well vary between member states. In particular, if you succeed in applying for a visa from one member state, and then enter the Schengen area through another member state, it might be that the border guards there would be confused rather than reassured if you present a visa.\n",

    "answer_id": "155167",
    "answer": "The full communication can be found here in English:\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/legislation/c20201830_en.pdf\n\nThe parts I think will be of most interest to the most people are those concerning cancellations by the airline, cancellations by the passengers themselves and compensation for delays and cancellations.\n\nFlight Cancellations by Airline\n\nIn the case of a flight cancellation by the airlines (no matter what the cause is), Article 5\nobliges the operating air carrier to offer the passengers the choice among:\n\na) reimbursement (refund);\n\nb) re-routing at the earliest opportunity, or\n\nc) re-routing at a later date at the passenger's convenience.\n\nThe guidance also makes very clear that if an airline offers a voucher instead of the choice between refund or re-routing, this does not affect the passenger's right to opt for a refund.\n\nFlight Cancellation by Passenger\n\nIn cases where a passenger cannot or no longer wants to travel, whether or not the passenger is refunded or re-routed depends on the ticket type as specified by the airline's terms and conditions.\n\nRight to 261/2004 Compensation\n\nIn short...a passenger is not entitled to EU261 compensation  for to delays or cancellations related to the pandemic. The airline still has a duty of care to their passengers who are travelling, which you can read more about. \n",

    "answer": "Travel of this sort is either permitted or it's not. If there are restrictions on travel in your area you should follow them. If there are not then it's allowed.\n\nFor example, if you were in Italy or France on this day (March 21 2020) then such travel would be forbidden - it's not essential travel. As I understand it there are no restrictions on internal travel in the US - but that's the situation today and it could be different tomorrow.\n\nYou should also listen to the advice of medical professional about what is discouraged. Anything you do that increases contact increases the chance of spreading Covid-19 is going to make the overall situation worse - and most kinds of travel will result in increased contact. If your medical professionals are asking you not to travel unnecessarily, don't do it.\n",

    "question": "Back in January, I booked to stay in Hotel Disneyland Santa Fe in March (in Paris). Due to the effect Covid-19 has had in everyday life and travel, Disneyland Paris had to close including the hotels for guests who were not there at the time of the closing down decision. I contacted Booking.com 5 days before my stay at the Hotel and explained the situation and they said they would get back to me in 24 hours. \n\nIn the meantime, I contacted the hotel and they said that I should only deal with Booking.com as it's their booking to manage. The hotels in Disneyland Paris also announced that for the visitors affected they would offer either a full refund or a chance to reschedule for a later date whilst keeping the same charge for the rooms as the ones in their original booking. \n\nNow Booking.com says that since the reservation wasn't cancelled beforehand and they're unable to cancel it after the arrival date has passed, they can only offer me half of the money back. I should note that on my initial phone call with them I wasn't told to cancel the booking or do anything for that matter, as they would have to investigate the best way to resolve this. \n\nThe booking was made using my credit card, but since it was made in January, I'm now out of the period that I can ask them to step in and withdraw the money and return them back to my account. \n\nIs there anything that I can do at this point to make sure I get my money back for a travel that I was not allowed to make considering the hotel was not accepting guests and the French government was cancelling my Eurostar trains at the same time (Eurostar, by the way, has issued a full refund since my trains got cancelled). Alternatively is there any official route to report this behaviour or complain about it?\n\nI live in the UK if that's relevant at all.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "This is 100% to be a scam. Let's see why:\n\n\na viewing before completing the transaction through Booking.com would not be possible. &lt;= this is where you should run screaming and not read anything else. Even if the place exists, how would you know it's not a mold infested, badly insulated garbage heap?\nIf they wanted to do a  real long term rent through an app they would use airbnb which allows for this and not booking.com which doesn't. It is a huge red flag they want to use a platform not suited for long term. \nI will send you the booking invitation through the Booking.com system &lt;= once again, airbnb has this but even there only after enquiring after a property, Booking.com very simply does not have such a feature. This person is talking nonsense, we will see why.\nBooking.com will automatically provide the tenancy agreement. &lt;= the very reason Booking.com stops at 30 days is because in a lot of jurisdictions 30 days is where a short term becomes a tenancy and booking.com does not want to mess with tenancy agreements. Booking.com most assuredly will not provide a tenancy agreement! I have first booked an apartment with Booking.com close to five years ago and there's nothing even remotely close to a tenancy agreement in all those emails, I reviewed a few again.\nIf you don't like the property for any reason, Booking will refund your money on the same day. &lt;= Booking.com doesn't exactly work like that. As this blog post shows, the host sets the cancellation policy and up until very very recently the scammer was able to siphon the funds off as soon as the reservation becomes 90% non-refundable, otherwise on the guest’s check-in date. See for example here. Right now, because of the COVID-19 situation, they can only get their money one day past check in per this update but I somewhat suspect they are not 100% up-to-date. Also, do you want to convince Booking.com that the apartment simply doesn't exist within less than 24 hour before your money is gone? If Booking.com doesn't side with you then your only avenue is to sue them in a Dutch court of law.\n\n\nFinally, if I needed to make a grim bet, I would put my money on this being nothing more than bait-and-switch and they don't want to use Booking.com: you agree to this, and after some hemming and hawing and probably a few juicy photos they come back complaining about some problems with booking.com listing and ask for a plain vanilla WU wire. By this time you are hopefully hooked enough to go ahead with it, if not, what's there to lose for them? You can even test it by agreeing and see what happens, just don't send money to them... \n\nAnd if you are wondering how people rent long term in a different country: they might have boots on the ground (company or friend) and if they don't then just do a short term rent much like it'd be a vacation and get a place once you are there. Easy as pie. I did so when I landed in Vancouver.\n",

This voucher is valid for 1 year on all Air France, KLM, Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic flights. This voucher will be refundable after one year if it is not used.\"\n\n\nSource\n\nThat seems like a ploy to circumvent EU261 regulations which I believe require a full refund in cases of cancellations. Air France is offering sort of a refund but with one year delay built in. \n\nBackground: we have an US&lt;->India ticket booked on Expedia with an Air France ticket. We obviously can't fly this and some legs have already been cancelled anyway. We like a full refund, not airline credit.\n\nQuestion: What's the best strategy to approach this? We shouldn't really call Expedia until 72-hours before departure, Air France says \"call your travel agent\" and I'm worried that Expedia will simply say \"airline is offering credit: take it or leave it.

If they hadn't come up with this voucher policy and instead decided to acknowledge their obligations up front, they would probably nonetheless drag their feet a year or more before actually giving you the money.\n\nThat said, the regulation does in fact specify reimbursement within seven days.  So you could pursue them if you want to.  Short of hiring a lawyer, the regulation provides that you can seek enforcement through the national enforcement body designated under Article 16(1).

    "question": "In response to the current pandemic, the government of Canada recently said to:\n\n\n  Avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada\n\n\nOther governments have made similar statements restricting travel.\n\nSo, if one is to avoid non-essential travel: What essential travel is allowed?\n\nBelow are some examples that came to mind but what are exactly determines if travel is in fact essential?\n\nThings that come to mind:\n\n\nJournalists going to where they want to investigate for a report.\nGoing to help isolated family members\nBusiness meetings and factory visits, whether to establish policy or oversee measures that related to the COVID-19 or other task related to production.\n\n\nIs any proper documentation needed to show that travel is essential?

    "answer": "Some examples that I have seen in the media:\n\n\na healthcare worker who lives in Windsor, Canada and works in Detroit, USA. There are thousands of such people and they cross the border every day. They are doing so to deliver an essential service (healthcare) so their travel is essential\na truck driver pulling a load of food, medical supplies or other essential goods. While in theory the delivery company could have the truck handed off to a different driver at the border, more realistically the truck and driver will be allowed in as essential travel\na patient returning to their home city to keep an appointment for needed surgery. Most elective surgeries, dentist appointments and such are being cancelled, but a person could have been away just before their scheduled surgery\nfarm workers from Central America are going to be allowed in to Canada because our farms can't function without them\n\n\nWhat is not essential?\n\n\ntourism\nbusiness or work that does not serve an essential purpose (making a movie, looking for new restaurant locations to buy or rent in another city, negotiating a big purchase business-to-business of something non-essential like bathing suits or makeup)\npeople who feel they would be less likely to catch this if they went to their second home in the country\npeople who prefer the weather in Ontario to the weather in Alberta at this time of year\n\n\nIf I was going to do some essential travel I would bring whatever proof I could, and I would prepare for a significant wait while my explanation was evaluated. I am tempted to say, if you have to ask, it's not essential. I personally have cancelled a followup CAT scan and MRI scan required by a clinical study I am in. Everything's been stable for a while, so I'm not going to the big city. It doesn't feel essential to me. \n\nMarch 28th, the CBSA tweeted this image:\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that in many Canadian provinces, non-essential workplaces are closed, so where this image says \"work\" it means \"essential work\".\n\nAlso, this applies only to people without symptoms. People with symptoms, whether citizens returning home, truck drivers pulling essential supplies, anyone will be refused or (more likely) taken into quarantine until they test negative. Also March 28th people with symptoms will be refused boarding on domestic flights and trains, regardless of the reason for travel.\n",

    "title": "Who is responsible for the refund policy on a code-share flight?",
    "question": "During July 2019, I booked flight UA7938 for March 30 through United Airlines for my honeymoon. With everything involving Covid-19 happening, I'm trying to see if I can get a refund for the ticket or an extension on the ticket. My main issue is that I do not know who is responsible for a potential refund. United is the marketing airline and ANA is the operating airline.\n\nUnited is waiving change fees for flights booked prior to March, which I can apply to my ticket online, but I would have to travel before July 2020. I don't know what kind of travel I can do before July and I do not want my money to go to waste. On the other hand, ANA has been issuing refunds for all international flights booked prior to March. Do I follow United's policies or can I follow ANA's? Has anyone had luck with similar situations?\n",
    "answer_id": "155274",
    "answer": "When you buy an airline ticket there are up to 3 separate airlines that can be involved for each leg of the flight.  These are common known as :\n\n\nThe \"Marketing Carrier\".  This is the airline who's flight number is on the ticket/itinerary.\nThe \"Operating Carrier\".  This is the airline who's aircraft will actually fly the flight.\nThe \"Ticketing Carrier\".  This is the airline that actually sold you the ticket.\n\n\n(The ticketing carrier will be the same for all legs of the flight on the same ticket. The other two can vary from leg-to-leg)\n\nIn many cases, all 3 will be the same - you buy a ticket from airline XX, for flight XX123, which is flown by airline XX themselves.\n\nIn your case, all 3 are not the same.  UA7938 is marketed as a United Airlines flight (thus the UA flight number), but the operating carrier is ANA.  What we can't tell from the information you've provided is who the Ticketing Carrier is - and that's the one that actually matters here!\n\nIf you purchased your ticket directly from an Airline website, then you can be fairly sure that's the ticketing carrier.  If you purchased it from a travel agency, then it's a little more complex.  In general, if all flights on a ticket are for the same marketing airline (eg, all UAxxx flight numbers) then most likely the ticket was issued by that airline.\n\nTo be certain, you'll need to check the ticket itself. In your email confirmation (or on the relevant website for where you bought the ticket) you should find a \"ticket number\" which is generally around 13 numbers long.  The first 3 digits in this number show who the Ticketing Carrier is.  If this number is 016, then your ticket was issued by United Airlines.  If it's 205, ANA.  If it's 014, it's Air Canada.\n\nNow, back to your original question. The policies that apply in a situation like this will be the policy of the TICKETING carrier.  That carrier might be influenced by the OPERATING or MARKETING carriers policies, but officially it is the ticketing carrier that you've paid for your ticket, and it's them that has your money up until the time that you actually take the flight.\n\nIn your case it's most likely that United is the ticket carrier so it would be their policies that apply - but you'll need to check the ticket number to be sure!\n",

    "question": "I am planning to rent an apartment for a year in Cambridge, UK. We liked a property, but the owner wants to rent it through booking.com, and he is physically located in Switzerland. He sent us the following email.\n\n\n  Hi ****,\n  \n  I am sure you are aware of the current virus pandemic spread\n  worldwide; all doctors here in Switzerland are now the 1st line of\n  defense in the race to control the spread of the virus. Since I'm\n  working over 16 hours/day to help my colleagues to fight this pandemic\n  and as well it's not recommended to get a flight these days, a viewing\n  before completing the transaction through Booking.com would not be\n  possible.\n  \n  Also a video tour of the property is available if you would like to\n  check it out: URL \n      Allow me to explain the Booking.com process step by step.\n  \n  \n  Upon your request, I will list the property online on Booking.com for GBP 1,100 / month with all the bills included.\n  I will send you the booking invitation through the Booking.com system so you will have 24 hours to confirm it or the invitation will\n  expire.\n  Once you receive the booking invitation from Booking.com, you will have to choose your check-in date ( this would be the date that you\n  would prefer to move in ) &amp; staying period ( minimum one month and\n  maximum five years )\n  After registration, you will have to pay £ 2,200 to Booking.com to get your reservation confirmed. The payment of £ 2,200 would be used\n  as a 1 (one) month of rent + 1 (one) month security deposit. You can\n  use it as the last month of rent or take it back at the end of your\n  stay.\n  Booking.com will automatically provide the tenancy agreement. Booking.com's policy allows maximum 1-month bookings, but choosing a\n  more extended period will enable you to have the contract for it and\n  receive the invoice each month during the selected period.\n  Your deposit will be held by Booking.com in their system until your check-in, after which will be put in a DPS as per law.\n  After Booking.com confirms your payment of £ 2,200 Keycafe ( https://keycafe.com ) will provide you the location of the keys since\n  it is their main partner in these transactions. If you don't like the\n  property for any reason, Booking will refund your money on the same\n  day. If, after the viewing, you decide to rent it, you will have to\n  sign the tenancy agreement and forward it to me by fax or email.\n  \n  Let me know when would be the best time for you to list the property\n  online on Booking.com and forward you the listing.\n  \n\n\nIs this a genuine method to rent properties in a different country through booking.com, or is it part of an elaborate scam?\n",
    "answer_id": "156364",
    "answer": "This is 100% to be a scam. Let's see why:\n\n\na viewing before completing the transaction through Booking.com would not be possible. &lt;= this is where you should run screaming and not read anything else. Even if the place exists, how would you know it's not a mold infested, badly insulated garbage heap?\nIf they wanted to do a  real long term rent through an app they would use airbnb which allows for this and not booking.com which doesn't. It is a huge red flag they want to use a platform not suited for long term. \nI will send you the booking invitation through the Booking.com system &lt;= once again, airbnb has this but even there only after enquiring after a property, Booking.com very simply does not have such a feature. This person is talking nonsense, we will see why.\nBooking.com will automatically provide the tenancy agreement. &lt;= the very reason Booking.com stops at 30 days is because in a lot of jurisdictions 30 days is where a short term becomes a tenancy and booking.com does not want to mess with tenancy agreements. Booking.com most assuredly will not provide a tenancy agreement! I have first booked an apartment with Booking.com close to five years ago and there's nothing even remotely close to a tenancy agreement in all those emails, I reviewed a few again.\nIf you don't like the property for any reason, Booking will refund your money on the same day. &lt;= Booking.com doesn't exactly work like that. As this blog post shows, the host sets the cancellation policy and up until very very recently the scammer was able to siphon the funds off as soon as the reservation becomes 90% non-refundable, otherwise on the guest’s check-in date. See for example here. Right now, because of the COVID-19 situation, they can only get their money one day past check in per this update but I somewhat suspect they are not 100% up-to-date. Also, do you want to convince Booking.com that the apartment simply doesn't exist within less than 24 hour before your money is gone? If Booking.com doesn't side with you then your only avenue is to sue them in a Dutch court of law.\n\n\nFinally, if I needed to make a grim bet, I would put my money on this being nothing more than bait-and-switch and they don't want to use Booking.com: you agree to this, and after some hemming and hawing and probably a few juicy photos they come back complaining about some problems with booking.com listing and ask for a plain vanilla WU wire. By this time you are hopefully hooked enough to go ahead with it, if not, what's there to lose for them? You can even test it by agreeing and see what happens, just don't send money to them... \n\nAnd if you are wondering how people rent long term in a different country: they might have boots on the ground (company or friend) and if they don't then just do a short term rent much like it'd be a vacation and get a place once you are there. Easy as pie. I did so when I landed in Vancouver.\n",

    "title": "Are there alternatives for booking flights unavailable directly via the airline (but available from an Online Travel Agent?)",
    "question": "This year I had something happen to me twice, which I never witnessed before nor I thought possible: An airline has flights for the legs that I'd like to fly on, but if I try to book the whole trip, it only proposes me a more complex trip with an extra leg. In the meanwhile, the desired booking is possible on an OTA website.\n\nI presume that this might be because OTAs have access to more inventory, but this seems weird. The two examples were:\n\nLondon to Yekaterinburg: I flew with British Airways + S7. They are partner airlines and S7 can sell me the London-Moscow leg of the trip, but S7 was only offering me a more complex trip (something like: London - Berlin - Moscow - Yekaterinburg)\n\nLondon to Longyearbyen: I booked a SAS trip with Layover in Oslo (cancelled due to Covid19), but the SAS website was only offering me trips like: London - Copenhagen - Oslo - Longyearbyen or London - Stockholm - Oslo -Longyearbyen \n\nIn the above cases, I booked from an OTA, but I'd really prefer to avoid in the future (in one direction, my luggage couldn't be checked-in all the way through even if that went smoothly on the way back. I got multiple check-in codes for the same booking, and making changes is just overall much more painful if a travel agent is involved).\n\nI just managed to find another example (again, for Longyearbyen: just an example, since I'm not currently planning of flying there in September):\n\n\n\nAs you can see, for the day only trips with 2 layover are offered.\n\nBut I checked on 4 different OTAs, and all of them are offering a booking with a single layover:\n\n\nExpedia\n\nLucky2go\n\n\n\n\n\nLastminute\n\n\n\n\n\nGotogate\n\n\n\n\nThis seems even weirder, when you consider that the single legs are actually available for purchase on SAS itself:\n\n\n\n\n\nBut somehow, SAS doesn't allow me to purchase this trip directly with them.\n\nHow common is this? Are there other solutions besides booking via an OTA? Would I be able to maybe get the booking done by directly calling the airline? (and if so, would this be standard practice, or should I expect it to be hit and miss depending on the airline?)\n",
    "answer_id": "156470",
    "answer": "This happens quite regularly for multi-carrier trips. Less so for single carrier trips.\n\nAirline search algorithms are often inferior\n\nFor single carrier trips, it's almost always because the airline's search algorithm doesn't find the trip you want, not because the airline doesn't sell it.\n\nIf the search tool is an in-house product, it may be inferior in an absolute sense compared to something like ITA's QPX search, which many OTAs now use. Writing a search algorithm for airline flights is a terrifically hard problem (formally it is classed as \"undecidable\"), and airlines don't hire the kind of computer scientists who can solve it efficiently. Specialists like ITA have hundreds of computer scientists.\n\nAlternatively, an airline's search may be tuned with different preferences to an OTA. A lot of airlines try to avoid overnight stops, even if that would be preferable to three flights at a higher price. I would guess that's the cause of your SAS problem here.\n\nSolutions\n\n\nTry the multicity search, and put some of the connecting cities in as if they were stopovers. When you choose the dates, choose the dates that you'll actually fly that leg. This is often a good bet, but it sometimes causes the airline to price your trip with a fare break point at the stopover (i.e., as a sum of one way fares instead of a single through fare): Iberia.com is particularly terrible for this shortcut. However, I notice SAS has helpfully removed its multicity feature as part of the dumbing down exercise that makes the rest of its webpage unusable on a real computer.\nBookwithmatrix or Google Flights can sometimes link you directly to the desired itinerary on the airline's site. (If you do this on aa.com, you'll find that you get kicked out at the payment stage if your credit card's address isn't in the United States. But it turns out AA doesn't actually validate the country field, so you can just leave it set to United States.)\nCall the airline, tell them what flight numbers you want to fly, and give them the price you expect. There is usually a telephone booking fee for doing this, although if you have some status with the airline it might be waived, particularly if you explain their website was not good enough to do it online. I used to have a friend at the Amsterdam ticketing desk for British Airways. In what I consider a crowning achievement some years ago, I constructed a price for a trip from information on expertflyer.com that was 50% lower than his system or any OTA admitted, and after some back and forth with revenue management, he agreed it was a bug in their pricing system and sold me the itinerary at the lower price. :-)\n\n\n\n  (and if so, would this be standard practice, or should I expect it to be hit and miss depending on the airline?)\n\n\nBA, AA, KLM, 90% success rate, sometimes have to hang up and call again. Qantas, JAL, Cathay Pacific, their telephone staff and ticket desks are always reliable. Air France, maybe 50%. Iberia, Alitalia, LATAM: total waste of time. \n\nPoint-of-sale differences in inventory\n\nSometimes, additional inventory is available in the city where the travel agent is based, compared to where the airline is calculating the price. To understand why that can be the case, you should know that \"how many seats left for sale on a plane\" is a function of the sales city as well as other factors. Airline websites, in my experience, usually price from the city of origin, whereas agents usually price from a fixed point. One way to see this is from the payment currency, which will invariably be the currency of the sales city. For instance expedia.fr prices out of Paris, regardless of whether the itinerary passes through that city.\n\nThis only seems to matter when the flight is filling up.\n\nTicket issuance restrictions in the fare\n\nSometimes, the airline really cannot sell you the trip. This may be because the trip comprises multiple fares and one of the fares has a restriction that it must be issued \"on the stock\" of a ticket airline. Stock here refers to the old fashioned 4-part carbon paper tickets, but the concept is directly implemented in electronic ticketing. For instance, looking at a cheap S7 fare from London to Yekaterinburg:\n\nCategory 15: Sales restrictions\n  TICKETS MUST BE ISSUED ON S7.\n         NOTE -\n          SALES PERMITTED ON TICKET STOCK VALIDATED OR\n          PLATED S7/421 ONLY.\n\n\nEven though a BA plane will fly you the first leg from London to Moscow, BA could not sell you a journey involving this particular fare. Airlines always sell tickets on their own \"paper\", not as agents for another airline; in this case, BA sells tickets on BA plate (ticket number starting \"125-\") and S7 sells tickets on S7 plate (ticket number starting \"421-\"). But a travel agent could pick any validating carrier with whom it has a ticketing agreement, subject to the fare rules and the agreement. So the travel agent has some additional flexibility. \n\nThis really only matters when you have a particularly complicated trip with multiple airlines who don't partner together very closely.\n",

    "question": "I have been searching for an answer to this but have not been able to get a definite answer. I am a Canadian citizen and will be flying from a foreign destination to Toronto and then have a domestic flight from Toronto to Vancouver. How would mandatory self-isolation of 14 days work in this case (self-isolate at Toronto or at Vancouver)? What other guidelines should I be aware of and what type of questions should I ask my airline?

However, upon arrival at your final destination, you must go directly to the place where you will isolate, and remain there for 14 days. This is because you are still at risk of developing symptoms and infecting others.\n\nYou may be subject to additional provincial or territorial public health measures at your final destination.\n\nIf you have symptoms of COVID-19, you will not be allowed to board any flight until:\n\n\n14 days have passed, or\nyou present a medical certificate confirming that your symptoms are not related to COVID-19\n\n\nIf you have signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19, you will not be allowed to use public transportation to travel to the place where you will isolate.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "The I-571 Refugee Travel Document is perfectly sufficient for re-entering the US. You should have no trouble with it unless you do something that makes the US question your status as an asylee... such as using the passport of the country you claimed asylum from.\n\nIt is a very, very bad idea to continue to use that passport in a way that the US might find out about it. If the US learns you are still using it, your asylee status could be revoked. This also means it's a very bad idea to have the Mexican visa placed in it. The details of everyone's departure from the US by air is passed to the government by the airlines; this is how the US does not have exit immigration controls as most countries do. If your departure is recorded on the passport of the country you claimed asylum from, your status is at risk.\n\nYou should apply for the Mexican visa with your Refugee Travel Document instead. This is perfectly safe and you do not have to worry about entering Mexico or returning to the US.\n",

    "question": "During these weeks many flights had been cancelled because of the COVID-19.\n\nWhy do some airlines and air travel agencies send confirmation emails even if the flight has been cancelled?\n\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\nLATAM: Flights from Peru were cancelled because of the state of emergency. However, one day before the flight, my flight was still appearing as SCHEDULED.\n\nI called LATAM to ask if the flight is indeed scheduled and not cancelled. They told me that so far they do not have that specific flight marked as cancelled in their systems and they recommended to check the next day (the day of the flight). They mentioned a refund can't be done because the flight is not cancelled.\n\nObviously, during the night, SCHEDULED turned into CANCELLED.\nDelta Airlines: Flight cancelled, but they send emails how to prepare for the flight and how to reach the airport and buy seats.\nKiwi.com and Opodo.com.uk: Flight cancelled, but they send notifications via email and push notifications to prepare for the flight and prepare my bags etc.\n\n\n\n\nApart from technical issues, is there any strategy in this scenario (e.g. marketing, whatever)?\n\nI am a programmer and I can imagine that in the source code they can simply have an if condition checking if the flight was cancelled to not send any notifications anymore related to how to prepare for the flight.\n",

    "answer": "'I'm a programmer...'\n\nInternational airline ticketing systems are huge, complex systems requiring interaction with the public, the staff, and other huge complex ticketing systems. Ensuring an accurate and timely flow of information through such a structure is no mean feat.\n\nThese systems were built for an environment where most flights departed on or fairly close to schedued time. In a matter of weeks the world has gone from that to an environment where most flights are now cancelled.\n\nYour 'simple \"if\"' may not be simple at all, but assuming the change was to be made, the process of approval, development, testing, staging and deployment could easily take weeks. There simply hasn't been time for such development to take place, even assuming that the developers consider that it's worthwhile.\n\nI suggest that with the chaos currently reigning in the air travel industry, receiving an email with directions to the airport has been considered unimportant. \n\nAirlines have bigger fish to fry.\n",

Pricing and Analytics is big business with advanced data crunching and thousands of variables.\n\nIt’s as simple as that. So far as consumers are willing to pay a certain price there is little motivation to reduce it.\n\nIf and when customers are unwilling to pay the price, the price will drop to the point where they are willing to pay for the goods or service. At that point if the price is such that the company’s costs are exceeding its income, the company either go bust or finds cost cutting measures and efficiencies or sometimes subsidized by government.\n\nBottom line the prices are high because customers still purchase. Although they both transport people, airlines and trains are not perfect competitors. Each has peculiarities that appeal to a segment of the consumer base at a particular price point.\n",

An official press release from the acting Secretary of Homeland Security is dated yesterday, March 26 2020.\n\nThe page quoted below has now been updated, as have the quotes themselves.  I've also adjusted the answer to account for the fact that Pennsylvania is now compliant with Real ID rather than being on an extension.\n\n\n\nHave a look at https://www.dhs.gov/real-id-public-faqs:\n\n\n  Q: When will I need to change how I travel domestically?\n  \n  Beginning October 1, 2021 every state and territory resident will need to present a REAL ID compliant license/ID, or another acceptable form of identification, for accessing Federal facilities, entering nuclear power plants, and boarding commercial aircraft. The card, itself, must be REAL ID compliant unless the resident is using an alternative acceptable document such as a passport or passport card, or state-issued Enhanced Driver’s License. The Act does not require individuals to present identification where it is not currently required to access a Federal facility (such as to enter the public areas of the Smithsonian) nor does it prohibit an agency from accepting other forms of identity documents (such as a U.S. passport or passport card).\n\n\nYou can use a Pennsylvania-issued document (license or ID card), even if the document is not compliant, through September 30, 2021.  After that, you'd need a compliant document or one issued by the federal government (for example, a passport or passport card).\n\nIs Pennsylvania compliant?  Does it have an extension?  See the main Real ID page at https://www.dhs.gov/real-id, which shows a map indicating that Pennsylvania is compliant.  You can choose Pennsylvania in the \"select a state\" box below the map to see the details:\n\n\n  Pennsylvania is compliant with the REAL ID Act. Federal agencies can accept driver's licenses and identification cards from Pennsylvania at Federal facilities and nuclear power plants.\n\n\nOn or after October 1, 2021, you'll need a Real-ID-compliant driver's license or your passport (or another document from the TSA list, if you have one).\n",

They may have procedures in place for any people coming for affected zones (China, Northern Italy, Iran...) to be isolated from other staff and/or the public.\n\nIt is difficult to guess what measures will be taken by the various authorities in Iran, Qatar and Austria regarding quarantine and isolation, or even outright travel bans, as this can change by the hour.\n\nQatar Airways have already cancelled 2 out of 3 of the flights from Tehran to Doha these last few days, and in the upcoming days.\n\nEven if there are no bans or quarantines, and even taking into account switching to a larger plane and cancellations/rebookings, squeezing passengers booked on 3 different flights on a single probably means severe overbooking. Be prepared to be bumped off the flight if there are Qatari citizens or residents and/or premium passengers that need a seat on that plane.\n\nThe remaining flight on Saturday has been rescheduled to over an hour earlier. Add to that there will probably be lots of additional checks before boarding, and the fact that there will be overbooking, and you should be at the airport a LOT earlier that you would normally have, probably before midnight. You want to be the first in the queue. If online/mobile check-in is possible, do it as soon as it opens. You want your boarding pass to show \"SEQ 001\".\n\nI suppose the rescheduling is to account for additional checks on arrival (as well as thorough disinfection of the aircraft after the flight) in order not to have issues with short connections.\n\nCurrent Qatar Airways procedures for flights from Iran:\n\n\n  In line with various global and local health warnings, all incoming passengers from Iran and South Korea whose final destination is Doha and are showing no symptoms of the Novel Coronavirus will be asked to stay in home isolation or a quarantine facility for 14 days.\n  \n  Passengers arriving from those countries who are showing symptoms will be transferred to the Communicable Disease Centre at the Hamad Medical Corporation.\n\n\nSo if you do not show any symptoms and are only in transit, you should have no issue boarding the flight to Vienna, unless Austria implements bans or quarantines by then.\n\nGood luck!\n",

    "title": "Is refund possible if I cannot take a (just rebooked) flight because of coronavirus bans?",
    "question": "My wife had a return flight ticket from Seoul to Barcelona via Istanbul at Turkish Airlines for March 6th. We received a mail today (March 2nd) saying please call our Call Center. We called and they said the flight was cancelled. They gave us the options for a refund or change. When asking which changes were possible, they offered the same flight for the 11th of March. I asked if there could be some problem because of the novel coronavirus and they said they had no information. We changed our flight to March 11th, because they said that if the same happened again and it was cancelled again we could get the refund.\n\nNow I've learnt in IATA's list (https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm, update from March 1st) about Turkish ban of non-turkish nationals who have been to Korea recently. I think it isn't likely this ban will disappear soon (right?) so we're looking for alternatives like flights via Germany or direct flights to Barcelona.\n\nNow I'm worried that if Turkish Airlines actually does their March 11th flight but they don't let any non-turkish nationals on, they may argue that no refund is possible because it's the passenger responsibility to check that they have all the rights to enter the countries for every layover, at the time they get the flight. Are we going to get a refund? I called the Call Center again but they said they had no information about this.\n\nMy wife is Korean but she is currently living in the EU. I think they should have known that because of my wife's nationality she was not allowed to travel. The ticket fare was the cheapest, no cancellations allowed.

In particular, if you are not allowed to board, then Turkish Airlines will not be required to give any compensation.\n\nThe good news is, that the travel advisory does not prohibit people from transiting through Turkey.  In fact, since practically all Europe -- US flights are cancelled due to the travel bans of both countries, this is the currently the cheapest way for me to transit between the two, given that I have the right to enter both.  Get on a Turkish Airlines flight from Europe to Istanbul, and from there a Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to the US.  Since Turkey is not on the travel ban of either country, the flights continue as planned.  Also, since I am not \"entering\" Turkey but merely transiting through it, this is also allowed by Turkey.\n\np.s., I am aware that this particular flight had been cancelled; the above is general advice for others in the same situation.\n",

    "question": "First of all, I will honestly admit that I adopted the style of question from the following thread: \n\nIs traveling to Italy safe during the COVID-19 outbreak?\n\nHowever, unlike Nevi, I intend to disclose personal information s.t. it can be objectively judged whether traveling to Spain is secure or not. \n\n\nI am under 28, male and have no disease or anything similar - as far as I know, anyway. \nI intended to travel to Barcelona from 15th March to 05th April, \ngetting there by train via Hannover-Cologne (ICE), Cologne-Brussels (ICE),  Brussels-Paris (Thalys) and Paris-Barcelona (TGV). On the return journey: Barcelona-Paris (TGV), Paris-Frankfurt (TGV), Frankfurt-Hannover (IC). \nThe plan was to go to a language school by midday and in the afternoon, get to know Barcelona itself. This trip is being offered by my scholarship that I have for my studies. \nI haven't reached out to them yet, because usually, if canceling a trip to a a language school, they require you to pay the entire fee of 1,000 € (no spelling error), unless you prove you were ill (by going to a doctor). But maybe, they make an exception due to the circumstances - I think I should reach out to them soon. \nI currently live in Germany in a big city and my dad is a taxi driver who often has guests from the airport as well, so the question is: Aren't I equally exposed to the Corona-virus in Germany, i.e. at home? \nOn the 6th April, my term officially starts, and from mid-April, I wanted to start my Bachelor Thesis, so it would be great if I weren't in quarantine in April. \nAlso, I care about getting the virus to my home community - I mean, who doesn't? But then, the question is, shouldn't my dad stop taxi driving for a while? I told him my opinion, but he said we need money for a living. \nI have already booked the tickets for 360€ and after having informed myself, I probably would get back only 44€. However, I understandably don't care about the money right now. \n\n\nEDIT: Alright, I searched for an alternative and found one: I could take a \"Flixbus\" from Frankfurt (Main) Central Station to Barcelona directly and vice versa. The costs for the entire trip would be around 100€, and I can get easily from Hannover to Frankfurt/from Frankfurt to Hannover with an IC(E). However, the only question is whether I have to travel or not ... I mean, if the situation should escalate in Barcelona/Spain/Europe, then I could be in quarantine and that wouldn't be great. \n\nEDIT EDIT: If sb wants to now, I decided to cancel my trip. I will lose around 1,050 € at least, since my scholarship isn't ready to officially cancel the trip. \n\nBest regards, \nMathIsFun\n",

There are several clusters whose source hasn't been fully elucidated, including one very close to Paris. At this moment, the French government does not advise against travel in general (only in the Oise and Haute-Savoie département) but the situation could evolve quickly. It did activate “stage 2” of its emergency plan meaning the virus is circulating through the population and the focus is on slowing it down rather than isolating clusters and risk areas.\nIf the situation worsens, you could conceivably be putting others at risk. There are few restrictions on travel in Europe and blanket bans or border closures seem unlikely but if anything, Spanish authorities should be more concerned about people like you coming from France than you should be about being in Spain.\nIt's possible the outbreak would develop further while you are in Spain to the point of making your return more difficult or, indeed, mean isolation would be recommended when coming back to Germany.

For some reason you are more afraid of Paris than Cologne or Barcelona, and more afraid of trains than buses.\n\nAt this point, my honest suggestion is that you do whatever makes you feel most comfortable. \n\nGiven that you have already decided to travel, and to travel by either train or bus, the choice between those two matters little.\n\nOn a train, you'll be in a carriage with 120 people. A dozen or so in close proximity to you. In a bus you'll be with 60 people. A dozen or so in close proximity to you.

For example, here are the USA's TSA comments on head coverings.\n\nAs far as what you can do to minimize the chances of an incident, the only advice I could give would be the same that I'd give to any passenger, regardless of race or religion - consider the feelings of everyone else on the plane, and try not to do anything that would cause any undue impact or concerns to others on the plane.  For example, there was a recent report of a passenger praying whilst on a plane, which people took offence at - not for religious reasons, but because in doing so he was blocking access to the aisles and toilets.\n\nSimilarly I would probably not recommend you decide to start speaking Arabic to another passenger located on the other side of the plane (ie, at a high volume) - just as I would not recommend a passenger shout out a welcome to his friend Jack on the other side of the plane (\"Hi Jack!\").\n\nIn a perfect world, such discrimination would not exist, but the simple fact is it does.

Under the current circumstances I suggest anyone planning to come to Europe just cancel or postpone. \n\nA Schengen visa normally allows one to enter any Schengen country. \nThere is no obligation to enter the Schengen area through the country that issued your visa. \nSo entering via France (or any other country) is not an issue. \nIt is pretty common even.\n\nThe rule that you must apply to the consulate of the country that is your main destination exists to spread the workload, and to counter visa shopping. \nTo enforce that rule the immigration officer stamping you in may want to see hotel and flight reservations proving that indeed you plan to follow the itinerary on your Schengen Visa application. \nArriving at the border with evidence suggesting that your plans are very different from those stated in your application will raise red flags, and may lead to a refusal.\n\nThis under normal circumstances. \nHowever we are no longer under normal circumstances. \nDeciding to no longer visit Italy is completely reasonable in light of the current situation. \nSo I would guess that cutting Italy out of your plans is not going to raise a red flag. \nYou should however inquire with the French consulate and the  French border police (dcpaf-em-cnic@interieur.gouv.fr).\n\nOne last thing: \nThe way things are currently progressing all of Europe will be where Italy is now in about 10 days (and so might your home country). \nYou might want to completely postpone your trip. \n",

    "wrong_answer": "Ethiopia was formerly a fully state-controlled, Marxist economy and despite slow liberalization, many sectors remain government controlled.  This includes aviation, where Ethiopian Airlines has a de facto monopoly on domestic flights.  Hence fares are both high and fixed: it's a legacy of state control and there's no competition.\n\nThat said, it may apparently be possible to score cheaper flights via travel agencies in Ethiopia, so it may be worth exploring other options.  Bear in mind that Internet penetration in Ethiopia also remains low, so if your schedule is flexible, it might make sense to do this after arrival.\n\nIncidentally, Ethiopia is not alone in this pricing scheme, I recall running into the same system in eg. Laos and a number of Central Asian countries as well.  Often there's a dual pricing system that charges top dollar for foreigners and has subsidized pricing for locals, but I'm not sure if this is the case for Ethiopia as well.  (Update: It appears this is indeed the case, with a 66% discount for residents &amp; people traveling to/from Ethiopia on Ethiopian Airlines.)\n",

    "title": "How can travelers ensure their safety when flying during the COVID-19 epidemic?",
    "question": "In light of the current pandemic, how can travelers ensure that they're not infected while taking the plane? Would it be sufficient to wear a N95 mask with protective goggles or does one require a full-blown hazmat protection suit to ensure absolute safety?\n\nI am aware that the best course of action is to avoid travel altogether, but let's presume that this is not an option.\n",

    "answer": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public: When and how to use masks\n\n\nIf you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection.\nWear a mask if you are coughing or sneezing.\nMasks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.\nIf you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly.\n\n\nFrom : https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019\n\nProtection measures for everyone\nStay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.\n\nYou can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:\n\n\nRegularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand\nrub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.\nMaintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.\nAvoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.\nWhy? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.\nMake sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.\nStay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.\nKeep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.\n\n",

    "wrong_answer": "These are just my guesses as a system developer working with fraud detection.\n\n\n\nSince the e-Gates are using the image (stored in the chip) in your passport, two people having faces looking almost the same and going through the gates so soon after each other should trigger a warning.\n\nTo solve this you could do plastic surgery or maybe use different flights so that the time between using the e-Gates is larger. I guess the timeout could be just 5 minutes.\n\nYou could also try wearing a hat, glasses or makeup.\n\n\n\nI actually have the exact same image in both my passport and my EU National ID Card. If they were to be used within 5 minutes of each other, the 2nd should also be declined. But say I leave the country and then come back and use my other ID, I should be let in.\n\nI got the same image in both as I applied for both at the same time. They're pretty cheap in Sweden.\n",

    "title": "How does the US COVID-19 travel ban apply to the EU spouse of a US citizen?",
    "question": "I am a French citizen, legally married to a US citizen. I currently live in Germany while my husband lives in the US.\n\nI was supposed to fly to the US on Sunday (March 15) on a Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to visit my husband in the US for two weeks (until March 30). I am wondering if I can still get on the flight, and whether I should.\n\nIt is clear in the presidential proclamation that the travel restriction does not apply to spouses of US citizens. However I wonder how this is enforced. I travel with my French passport and an ESTA (visa waiver), I do not have any spouse visa or anything. Is it the airline who decides to let me on the flight? Or is it up to the immigration officer once I arrive in the US?\n\nI also don't know if the flight is going to be cancelled. As far as the flight status shows, it is not cancelled, but I wouldn't trust that.\n\nTo make matters more difficult for myself, I got a United reservation through Chase's travel rewards program for a flight operated by Lufthansa. If the flight is cancelled or I cannot get on it, any idea who I should turn to for reimbursement? So far I have not been able to get a hold of Lufthansa customer service, they must be overloaded. I have not yet tried United or Chase.\n\nSorry this is such a specific and self-interested question, I just thought some of you might have similar situations or more information to share.\n",
    "answer_id": "154911",
    "answer": "There are still a lot of unknowns at this stage, so it is quite difficult to answer with any degree of certainty.\n\n\nI expect you would need to be able to prove to someone (probably the airline, and then again CBP upon arrival in the US) that you are the spouse of a US citizen. Make sure you have a copy of your marriage certificate or other similar document, as well as a copy of your husband's passport.\nThere is a strong probability that many flights will be cancelled, though as US citizens and their immediate family are still allowed to travel to the US, there should still be a few flights. Which ones will be operating and which ones will be cancelled is the one million dollar question. You'll have to wait for Lufthansa to make a decision, taking into account that this could change quite late.\n\n\nI expect airlines to get in touch with passengers to:\n\n\nInform them of these new measures, and the exact details of what documents are required/allowed.\nProbably ask information so they know which passengers are still able to travel or not, which in turn will let them decide how many flights to keep, and which ones.\n\n\nGiven the surprise announcement, they're probably scrambling to make all of that happen.\n\nIf the flight is cancelled, you should be eligible for a refund. You should probably contact Chase at that point.\n\nIf the flight is NOT cancelled but you decide not to travel, we enter in the very gray area that the airline is probably not legally required to refund your ticket. They will most probably instead propose rebooking at a later date or the like. The fact that it's an award ticket may change things (is the ticket refundable?). Again, Chase is probably the right point of contact for this.\n\nEDIT\n\nThe Lufthansa Group have announced the cancellation of all but 6 flights to/from the US from March 14th:\n\n\n  The Lufthansa Group will continue operating flights from:\n  \n  \n  Frankfurt to Chicago and Newark (New York)\n  Zurich to Chicago and Newark (New York)\n  Vienna to Chicago and from\n  Brussels to Washington\n  \n  \n  beyond 14 March, thus maintaining at least some air traffic connections to the USA from Europe. The airlines are currently working on an alternative flight schedule for the USA. Passengers will still be able to reach all destinations within the USA via the U.S. hubs and connecting flights served by our partner airline, United Airlines.\n  \n  All other U.S. flights will be suspended until further notice due to U.S. administration restrictions, including all departures from Munich, Düsseldorf and Geneva. The Lufthansa Group will continue to serve all destinations in Canada until further notice.\n\n",

    "question": "I just had my Schengen visa appointment this morning in the UK and paid 300 pounds for my Schengen fees, Swisscare Schengen insurance, and roundtrip nonrefundable flight tickets with Swiss Air. However, as I am a exchange student from the U.S., my U.S. university just this afternoon(hours after my morning appointment) announced that all exchange students needed to return back to the U.S. immediately due to the recent coronavirus outbreak.

    "answer": "Insurance premium\n\nYou can cancel the insurance at any time before the coverage begins.  The company website says\n\n\n  Before the beginning of coverage, ... you can request a full refund at any time. \n\n\nVisa application fee\n\nYour visa fee is probably lost, but you might try asking if you can adjust your application dates.  I wouldn't hold my breath.\n\nAir fare\n\nRebooking\n\nSubject to some conditions, you can probably rebook the air tickets without change fees:\n\n\n  SWISS will waive its rebooking fees for all newly booked flights worldwide with immediate effect and until March 31 and offer a one-off free rebooking. For existing bookings, the new waiver policy will apply worldwide to all flights booked by March 5 with a departure date up to April 30, 2020. Passengers will thus be able to rebook their flight ticket once to a new date up to December 31, 2020 without incurring any rebooking fee.\n\n\nAs noted by Mark Johnson in a comment, this policy applies to the entire Lufthansa Group.\n\nRefund\n\nIf you're lucky enough that your flight is cancelled, however, you might get a refund:\n\n\n  For cancelled flights: If you have booked through swiss.com or a Service Centre and you don't want to rebook your flight ticket, you can refund your ticket. To do so, please complete the refund form.\n  \n  If you booked through an (online) travel agency, please contact the travel agency.\n\n\nI say \"might\" because I don't know whether you'd be able to get a refund if the flight is cancelled after you rebook it.\n\nTaxes and fees\n\nEven if you cannot recover your airfare, you should be entitled to a refund of certain taxes and fees for flights that you didn't actually take.\n\nPossible insurance claims\n\nIf you have any travel insurance or other general insurance, you may want to look at whether it would cover any losses you incur.  Again, I wouldn't hold my breath, but it's better to check now rather than to find out after the claim deadline has passed that you might have been eligible for reimbursement.  (The Swisscare Schengen insurance seems not to include trip cancellation coverage, but I did not look very closely.)\n",
