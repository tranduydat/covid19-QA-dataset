    "question": "What can we do with those people who still decided to travel (for skiing, example) and causing huge problems after they return, even though they know the fact that corona virus (or anything new in the future) is deadly and already spreading around the world?\n\n--\nUpdate:\n\nAccording to Phillip, I want to point out a specific country like Finland, with Finnish law, for Finnish people who traveled to Italy.\n\n--\nUpdate 2:\n\nI asked this question because I think in this way: If you're drunk and going to drive, and because of your irresponsible action could lead to the danger for some (one, two, maybe ten people), so you will be punished, even when you have not made a scratch to anybody.\n\nBut then why do there are people who would do something which leads to the danger of thousands of people, free to walk away?\n\n\n\nOf course, we can exclude people who do not know, and people who have important things to do.\n",

    "answer": "Communicable diseases are endemic to the human condition\n\nSome places, times and situations are riskier than others but there is always a risk in widespread travel. Outside of disease spread, there are other risks in travel; for example, if no-one traveled at all there would be no motor vehicle deaths.\n\nOn the flip-side, not traveling has its own dangers; for example, you will not die in a house fire if you are in your car.\n\nOf course, there are enormous benefits to widespread travel;  economic, cultural and personal - life is to be experienced after all.\n\nIf you stop the skier from skiing, then you have just damaged the livelihood of all the people who depend on tourism; the airline, the hotel, the bartender, the ski technician, the baker in the ski resort etc.\n\nEverything is allowed unless it is prohibited\n\nBy and large, this is the way that the law works. It's legal to do anything you like. Unless it isn't.\n\nIt isn't illegal to travel to, say, Finland. So you can.\n\nIf the government (of whichever country) decides that the costs of allowing people to travel to Finland now outweigh the benefits then they can prohibit it. However, that is a political decision; not a legal one.\n\nAs for your drink-driving example, I am old enough to remember when it wasn't illegal to drive drunk, although I was too young to drive. Of course, if you are in Somalia or Kenya it's still legal. Also, what counts a drunk varies by country - you can have a couple in Finland but cross over into Russia and you are breaking the law. Why does Finland allow such recklessness? Because it's a political decision and politicians in Finland and Russia have reached different conclusions about what level of risk is acceptable. Same with travel restrictions.\n",

No permits for Czech stay over 90 days will be issued, he said.\n  \n  Prague, March 12 (CTK) – All the passenger bus, train and ship transport to all neighbouring countries will be banned and air traffic will be reduced as of Saturday, the Czech Transport Ministry said after a government meeting today.\n  It will only be possible to travel abroad by car.\n  \n  What should I do if I am returning from a high-risk area? \n  According to the Ministry of Health, anyone returning from Italy to the Czech Republic must stay in home quarantine for two weeks, with a 3-million CZK fine for violating the regulation. \n  \n  Upon return contact your healthcare provider immediately — whether you are showing symptoms or not — to let them know. Your healthcare professional will work with health officials to determine if you need to be tested for COVID-19. \n  \n  Reinforcing health measures at the Schengen Borders\n  Under the Schengen Border Code, all decisions to refuse or accept entry to the territory of a Member State must be subject to an individual assessment undertaken by the competent authorities. It is the responsibility of the Member States to refuse entry on public health grounds to individual third country nationals.\n\n\nBased on Czech and EU laws, no Czech judge should have any objections about these measures. \n\nFrom the comments:\n\n\n  \n    This requires some fairly specific government rulings to reduce travelling. A priori citizens are free to travel pretty much anywhere. If for example I travel within Germany to the most affected county and then back to a major metro area, one could argue that I'm not very responsible but unless either me or the county are officially quarantined, I'm not liable for anything.\n  \n\n\nIn this case home quarantine for two weeks is mandatory and can be fined with € 115240,50. \n\nAny futher malicious activities (as done by the Japanese man, going out to deliberately ‘spread the virus’) by a person could lead to further civil and criminal charges (including liability for any cost or damages).  \n\n\n\n\n  Article 2 [Personal freedoms] \n  \n  (1) Every person shall have the right to free development of his personality insofar as he does not violate the rights of others or offend against the constitutional order or the moral law.\n  \n  (2) Every person shall have the right to life and physical integrity.

In general federal rules prevail over state rules, so yes the CDC can stop the state of New York from testing for COVID-19 if the CDC has not approved the testing protocol.\n\nThe primary reason behind the rules is to ensure that any tests provided to the public are reliable. A secondary reason it to ensure that the testing development process followed guidelines on medical ethics. There is a set of procedures for Emergency Use Authorization, but there have been widespread complaints that even that process has grown too cumbersome and time consuming.\n\nThere has been more extensive coverage of the CDC and FDA stopping/delaying testing in Washington state.\n",

    "answer": "\n  How can I truly say that I 'consent' to data collection and processing when I am coerced, so to speak, by the threat of failing my courses if I do not use this novel software?\n\n\nThere is no need for you to \"consent\".\n\nConsent is just one of the reasons that allows a data processor to collect your data. There are other reasons that allows the data processor to capture your data.\n\nIn this case, it seems of application the \"legitimate interest clause\", as it is in your university's legitimate interest to capture your activity in order to evaluate you.\n\nOf course, that covers only the data collected that is relevant to that interest. They will certainly capture your identity and your answers, they may log your sessions and may try to gather some data to detect if you are somehow cheating, but they would not be allowed to check which are your favorite pornhub videos because that is not relevant for the university's legitimate interest.\n\nArt. 6 of the GDPR states:\n\n\n  Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:\n  (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;\n  (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;\n  (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;\n  (d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;\n  (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;\n  (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\n\n\nThis page also provides some in-depth analysis\n",

    "wrong_answer": "In Canada as in the US, truth is a defence against defamation. Additionally, if the plaintiff makes the statement, then the defendant didn't, and the plaintiff would have no basis for pursuing a person who managed to get him to defame himself. If the people were to accuse the person of committing a crime (sex with a minor), then the potential for defamation exists, if that accusation was communicated to a third person (excluding police -- you can accuse a person to the police). In that case, the defendants might attempt to prove that the accusation was true, but I don't know how they would show that. If all they could do is prove that the guy acted kind of pervey but that actually accused him of having sex with a minor, then they would probably be in legal hot water. If they accuse him of doing what he actually did, that is not defamation. There is no law against getting a person to publicly admit to wrong-doing. \"Entrapment\" is something that only law enforcement can do (and it's illegal).\n\nSince it is not illegal in Canada for a person to offer sex for money (it is illegal to be a customer, though), the youths are not doing anything illegal. In the US, though, that would be illegal, so they too might get in trouble.\n",

Virginia, 75 U.S. 168. \nThe more recent case Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489 affirms the position that restricting the \"right to travel violates the Equal Protection Clause absent a compelling governmental interest\", and one of the specific rights subsumed under the right to travel is \"the right to enter and leave another State\".\n\nThe \"compelling governmental interest\" is a reference to standard of judicial review known as strict scrutiny, where a law that restricts a fundamental right (the right to travel) is required for a \"compelling state interest\", is \"narrowly tailored\" to that purpose, and is the \"least restrictive means\".\n\nIt is highly likely that each state has a statute that grants broad powers to the governor in case of a state of emergency.

The Art 2(2)(c) exemption for “purely personal or household activity” does not apply since you're offering the service to the public.\n\n\nYou must consider GDPR compliance here. This is especially important as you are showing personal data to the public. Don't do that unless you have a very good reason, appropriate safeguards, and are clear to users how their information will be shown.\n\nOn a high level, GDPR compliance involves working on the following questions:\n\n\nFor what purpose are you processing personal data?\n\nContext: purpose limitation principle per GDPR Art 5(1)(b)\nWhat is the legal basis for processing?\n\nGDPR Art 6(1) lists the available legal bases. Here, consent, necessity for performance of a contract, or a legitimate interest could be a legal basis. They may have further obligations attached. A legitimate interest requires a balancing test that considers the data subject's rights and freedoms. Consent must fulfil the conditions per Art 7 in order to be valid.\nWhat is the minimal data necessary to achieve the purpose?\n\nPer the Art 5(1)(c) data minimisation principle, it is illegal to process personal data beyond what is necessary and adequate. You must provide data protection by design and by default per Art 25. Special categories of data per Art 9 such as health data are illegal to process outside of narrow exemptions. You must delete data once it is no longer necessary.\nWhat appropriate safeguards and security measures should you apply?\n\nPer Art 24 and 25, you are responsible for determining and implementing appropriate measures. This depends a lot on your specific context, so there's no checklist you can apply. Per Art 25(1) you must pseudonymize the processed information if that is compatible with the processing purpose.\nWhat further compliance measures do you have to consider?\n\nThere are additional GDPR and non-GDPR compliance measures. From the GDPR side:\n\n\nUse the answers to these questions to write a privacy policy, including the information that you must provide to data subjects per Art 13.\nConsider whether you have to maintain a Records of Processing document per Art 30, or if you have to make a Data Protection Impact Assessment per Art 35. \nIf you use third party services, figure out whether they are a joint controller or data processor and apply appropriate safeguards.\nIf you have data processors, ensure that you have a contract in place that covers the items from Art 28(3).\nIf you share data with other controllers (not processors) you need a legal basis for doing so.\nIf you transfer data into a non-EU/EEA country (after 2020: non-UK country) you need a legal basis per Art 44 and have to cover additional items in your privacy policy. Ideally, the target country is covered by an EC adequacy decision per Art 45. For US-based companies, this is the case only when they have self-certified under the Privacy Shield framework.\n\n\nNon-GDPR compliance steps could include cookie consent banners, or showing a VAT ID.\nHow can you prepare for data subject requests?\n\nData subjects have various rights per Arts 15–23, subject to the modalities in Art 12. For example, a data subject could request that their information is erased from your website. The exact rights also depend on the legal basis you selected. You should figure out in advance how to deal with such requests.\n\n",

It prohibits any gathering of more than two people in public and private spaces, except if they live in the same household.\n\nWhat I am very unclear about is the extent to which certain behaviours are restricted by this regulation, as coverage in news is IMHO extremely unclear.\n\nFor instance, Berliner Morgenpost says:\n\n\n  Gruppen feiernder Menschen auf öffentlichen Plätzen, in Wohnungen sowie privaten Einrichtungen sind angesichts der ernsten Lage in unserem Land inakzeptabel.\n\n\nIn English:\n\n\n  Groups of partying people in public spaces, in apartments, as well as private facilities are inacceptable due to the serious situation in our country.\n\n\nTagesschau says:\n\n\n  Gruppen feiernder Menschen - auch im Privaten - sind inakzeptabel\n\n\nIn English:\n\n\n  Groups of celebrating people - also in private - are inacceptable\n\n\nAnd Merkur.de says:\n\n\n  „Gruppen feiernder Menschen sind inakzeptabel“, erklärten die Politiker unisono. Jegliche Feierlichkeiten sind untersagt, das gilt auch für Geburtstage.\n\n\nIn English:\n\n\n  \"Groups of celebrating people are inacceptable.\", the politicians explained in unison. Any kind of celebrations are prohibited, this includes birthdays.\n\n\nNow, what does this mean? At least some of the above statements can be interpreted in such a way that it's about the physically close group aspect. That is, celebrations whose participants meet in person in the same place are prohibited.\n\nBut then, all of those statements, and definitely the last one, also sound a lot like it's the very activity of celebrating that is prohibited, presumably because the \"serious situation in our country\" makes such a behaviour unbecoming. Thus, it sounds like restrictions similar to the Tanzverbot (that declare various overtly joyful activities to be unbecoming and thus unlawful on certain holidays) are in place.\n\nWhich interpretation is correct?\n\n\nAm I violating the newly imposed restrictions if I meet with some of my friends (each of which is sitting at home alone, or at most with their families) via videochat and \"celebrate\" (whatever is meant by that, let's count any joyful or relaxing leisure activity) with them online to brace against the effects of social isolation and cabin fever?\nAnd does it mean we cannot let our children have a joyful videochat with their friends whom they already cannot meet in person due to the closure of schools and child nurseries?\n\n",

    "answer": "What most of your quotes are based on is this general consensus reached by the federal and state governments on how to proceed.\nThe actually legal implementation happens on the state level in form of decrees.\nTherefore, the quoted texts are not to be taken as legal text, but human-readable¹. In particular they are not to be taken painstakingly literal, but context and common sense may be applied².\n\nThe actual decrees are much more specific and clear.\nFor example, let’s take the decree for Northrhine-Westphalia (translation mine):\n\n\n  § 11 Veranstaltungen, Versammlungen, Gottesdienste, Beerdigungen\n  \n  (1) Veranstaltungen und Versammlungen sind untersagt. Ausgenommen sind […]\n  \n  § 12 Ansammlungen, Aufenthalt im öffentlichen Raum\n  \n  (1) Zusammenkünfte und Ansammlungen in der Öffentlichkeit von mehr als 2 Personen sind untersagt. Ausgenommen sind […]\n  \n  \n  \n  § 11 Events, gatherings, religious services, funerals\n  \n  (1) Events and gatherings are forbidden. Exempt are […]\n  \n  § 12 Gatherings and presence in public space\n  \n  (1) Congregations and gatherings of more than two persons in public are forbidden. Exempt from this are […]\n\n\nMost of this is clearly about in-person meetings.\nThe only exception is the term “Veranstaltung” (event), which could be construed to cover online events.\nHowever, in other laws using this term, it clearly refers to in-person events.\nFor example parts of this law governing the number of toilets available at an event do not make any sense for online events.\n\nI see nothing in the decree that would forbid online celebrations. In fact celebrations are not mentioned at all (and are covered by more general terms in the degree, as far as they are in-person).\n\n\n\n\n¹ To be fair, the actual legal texts are not that bad in terms in human readability either.\n² Mind that I do not wish to accuse you of lacking common sense here. After all the consensus dissonating with your common sense made you ask this question.\n\n",

    "question": "I am currently laid off from my job due to the Coronavirus outbreak. My employer informed my coworkers and I in a group meeting on the day before the lay-off that we would all be brought back to work when it is safe to do so.\n\nIf my employer was to not bring me back to work after the outbreak is over, perhaps citing a work performance issue or something along those lines, can I sue them for wrongful termination after they verbally promised all of us that we would all have our jobs after the Coronavirus outbreak is over?\n",
    "answer_id": "50134",
    "answer": "People are laid off all the time when sales are down, the market is bad, etc: there is no legal \"right to a job\" except whatever is in your employment contract. There is a legal concept of promissory estoppel which boils down to promises being binding. However, there has to be a clear and definite promise, not for example a statement like \"we hope to bring you back after this is over\". \n\nNormally, the employer can argue that they have the right to fire you regardless of performance, and that would be the end of it. Let's say you have it in writing, and it is clear that they unconditionally promise to hire you back: you would want to (e)stop them from arguing that they have the right to fire you. The underlying idea of promissory estoppel is that such a promise keeps them from making that argument. But: it is not enough that they made the promise, you also had to rely on the promise and act / forbear from acting in some way because of that promise. It could be, for example, taking another job, or moving to another country, or simply looking for another job. The hard part, then, would be getting a clear and definite promise.\n",

None of the executive orders suspend this aspect of the law: the eviction order is directed at law enforcement, and orders a temporary delay in enforcement of eviction orders. The governor does not have clear constitutional or statutory authority to suspend all or part of ARS 33-1343. The initial declaration of emergency lists the various statutory authorities, such as ARS 36-787. In order to suspend the landlord access law, the legislative would have to enact a new law, which the governor would have to sign into law. There is no applicable federal order, and any such order would be of dubious constitutionality (landlord-tenant laws are a state matter, not a federal matter).\n",

Other counties nearby might be using the same provider. For instance, the Washtenaw (in Michigan) county trial court gives public access to cases register of actions. Knowing that, it was easier for me to identify the analog for Wayne and Oakland counties. But Jackson county used a different provider. Likewise, California courts might be using Odyssey or other providers. There is no uniformity on this.\n\nKeep in mind that an entity might have been involved in small claims court, which will not necessarily be reflected on the same site of county trial court.\n\nTo search for cases by party in California courts of appeal and supreme court, see here (the form to enter party appears after clicking on Search).\n\nTo search in the SCOTUS, see here.\n\nEach court has its own policies for ordering records of the proceedings.\n\nLeagle.com only displays decisions/opinions from appellate courts, supreme courts, and federal district courts. No litigation records are available from there. From personal experience as pro se litigant, I warn you that whatever you read in a court opinion does not necessarily reflect the actual evidence and arguments a party offered. Unfortunately, many courts are fond of distorting the record of a case for the sake of forcing an unlawful outcome.\n\nAlso beware that not all litigation happens in courts. A company could have gone through some Alternative Dispute Resolution method such as mediation or arbitration that might be of your interest nonetheless. Those proceedings would not be reflected in court sites unless at least one party escalates the issue (example: a party might appeal an arbitrator's ruling).\n",

If the contract says you get a refund, you get a refund, if it says you get a credit, you get a credit. Ultimately, if there is a complete and utter failure of consideration, you are entitled to a refund - that is if they cannot provide you with a flight within a reasonable time. In theory, when this all ends, they could contact you and say, “we can fly you tomorrow” - they would then have fulfilled their obligation even if you don’t want to fly tomorrow. Legally, this is fine, commercially, it would be a disaster.\n\nForce Majeure\n\nThis obscure area of contract law has become very relevant at this time. It means “superior force” and deals with what happens when a party is unable to fulfil its obligations under a contract through unforeseen in the contract and unforeseeable in practice events beyond either parties control. That is, between the parties, who took the risk of that unforeseeable event?\n\nIf the contract is silent then, under French (civil) law, Air France is relieved of its contractual obligations, that is, they are not in breach of their contract and are not subject to damage. However, if the contract is under Common (English/US etc.) law then they have breached their contract and owe you damages. Whose law is the contract under?

As a prelude, there would have to be some higher authority that empowers them to do this. You would have to scrutinize the emergency powers legislation of every state to be certain, but no governor has the power to mandate blanket body searches in case of a medical emergency. (Martial law shifts enforcement of the law to the military, but doesn't generally create arbitrary decree-writing powers).\n\nThe legal foundation of such searching would have to be a new law: then the question is what the law requires that could make on-the-road body searches constitutional. Since the right to be free of unreasonable searches is a fundamental constitutional right, this law would be reviewed under strict scrutiny. Searches \"just for fun\" will not pass such scrutiny, nor will \"because it's an emergency\" or \"keep the public safe\". Having the disease is not and cannot be a crime, so this law would have to be founded on a strict no-travel requirement. That brings the matter within the sphere of the \"officer safety\" exception in the case of an arrest. I'm not suggesting that an absolute travel ban would be upheld as constitutional in the US, but that is the kind of legal foundation that would be required for state police to force people to be Covid-searched.\n",

It also does not state that use of a car is not allowed.\n\nEdit:\n\nYes, this question is against the \"spirit\" of the law, but that is not the question being asked, if we get into the morality of it then we have to start taking peoples rights into consideration, one of those rights is to go where they want and to do what they want, even if that means that someone else suffers in some way.  People have fought and died for our rights over hundreds of years, you cannot just ignore that.\n",

    "answer": "There is no clear answer, and I suspect an argument could be made either way. \n\nThe relevant regulations in this case are The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020. In particular, regulation 6(1) states that:\n\n\n  6.—(1) During the emergency period, no person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse.\n\n\nIn this case, you would be relying on the reasonable excuse given in regulation 6(2)(b):\n\n\n  (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), a reasonable excuse includes the need—[...]\n  (b) to take exercise either alone or with other members of their household;\n\n\nThe regulations do not explicitly state:\n\n\nhow far you may travel for the purposes of exercise,\nhow long you may exercise for\neven, in contrast with government advice, how many times a day you may leave your house for exercise.\n\n\nIt would require the interpretation of the courts to decide whether travelling for long distances was reasonable in order to take exercise, and whether exercising for many hours is reasonable. Michael Gove stated in an interview that:\n\n\n  I would have thought that for most people, a walk of up to an hour, or a run of 30 minutes or a cycle ride of between that, depending on their level of fitness is appropriate.\n\n\nThis is of course not law, but opinion; yet it is worth keeping in mind that the courts may take a similar view to this.\n\nA strong argument could be made to say that this scenario is not in fact necessary exercise, but leisure, which is not considered a reasonable excuse in the regulations. Equally, it could be argued that the regulations do support travel for exercise in any form. I don't think anyone could answer with certainty whether this is legal or not, until the law is tested on this point.\n",

'one of those rights is to go where they want and to do what they want, even if that means that someone else suffers in some way'.... The Self-Entitled Weekly Magazine?\n\nActually not one of those (actual) rights stipulate any such thing and is why there was long overdue ban on smoking in certain public places in the UK ... ie. smoking whenever and wherever you want, even if that means that someone else suffers in some way.  \n\nIn short, yes I believe you would be in violation of the 'spirit' of the law, which will be considered as mentioned above. Of course it was reasonable to leave for exercise but was it reasonable to travel that far and was it reasonable to do so for that amount of time? I believe you would not be able to justify the distance or the time.  Note: even less so now the government have updated the rules on excercise to include: \n\n'stay local and use open spaces near to your home where possible – do not travel unnecessarily'\n\n'...once per day'\n\nthis was done specifically to address people 'bending the rules' by driving to open spaces and staying out for an inordinate amount of time.\n",

    "answer": "ICE has a degree of authority to deport without court hearing, via an expedited process. The legal framework for such deportations are explained here, and rely on  8 USC 1225. The Secretary of DHS has authority to establish rules, and has recently done so here. The current regulations pertaining to expedited removal are at 8 CFR 253.3. There is no exemption for people being medically treated, for covid-19 or any other reason, but \"parole\" is available (at the discretion of the attorney general) to \"parole\" an immigrant if it is \"is required to meet a medical emergency\". Thus an illegal immigrant in the ICU might be exempt from immediate deportation, but that is at the discretion of the AG. State and local officials do not have the authority to interfere in the enforcement of federal law, even if the state or municipality has declared itself a \"sanctuary\". The criminal penalties for interference are spelled out here; no law compells cooperation, the law simply prohibits forcible interference.\n",

    "title": "Are there laws in the USA that prevent news from reporting false information about a situation that could put lives at risk?",
    "question": "There has been quite a bit of misinformation flowing about COVID-19, some of it has even been reported on major news agencies, the one most heard about being Fox and Friends claiming, falsely, that the ability to hold your breath for 19 seconds is a good indicator of COVID-19 infection; but this is hardly limited to one show or wrong fact.  Given the threat of COVID-19, and how each infection increases the risk of future infections exponentially, the misinformation being spread could realistically put lives at risk.\n\nNow I'm not suggesting anyone be punished for COVID-19 misinformation specifically, for many reasons.  However, it got me wondering at a more general level if there are forces in place to handle more direct and blatant spread of dangerous misinformation via the news.\n\nIt does make me wonder what laws exist for intentional spread of misinformation.  Slander and Libel laws only apply to misinformation about an individual, they wouldn't apply to other forms of misinformation.  The FDA has stepped in to stop false claims about drugs and medication, but again that is only one specific type of misinformation.\n\nWhat about more general misinformation?  If some news agency decides as an April fools joke to report that the government is encouraging all kids to play on highways today, or some other grossly negligent and potentially dangerous fact, and there is reasonable evidence to suggest it was done intentionally what laws may be used to penalize such a dangerous spread of misinformation?\n",
    "answer_id": "50494",
    "answer": "While the other two sort out their disagreement, here's one way the broadcast of misinformation is regulated which is not subject to dispute.\n\nThere is a federal agency called the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  The FCC regulates interstate and international communications over TV, radio, satellite, cable, etc., throughout the US and its territories.  \n\nAmong its duties and powers, it prohibits the broadcast of false info regarding a crime or catastrophe if the broadcaster \"knows the information is false and will cause substantial 'public harm' if aired.\"  FCC rules indicate that the harm \"must begin immediately and cause direct and actual damage to property or the health or safety of the general public; or divert law enforcement or public health and safety authorities from their duties.\" \n\nAdditionally, while law prohibits the FCC from engaging in censorship or otherwise infringing on First Amendment rights of the press, it is nonetheless illegal for \"broadcasters to intentionally distort the news, and the FCC may act on complaints if there is documented evidence of such behavior from persons with direct personal knowledge.\" \n\nThe FCC may not interfere with how a broadcaster chooses to select or present news or commentary and its authority to respond to complaints regarding the above is narrow in scope.  Generally, it cannot intervene without testimony from a person with \"direct personal knowledge of an intentional falsification of the news.\" \n\nThe FCC's authority for this may be found at 47 CFR § 73.1217, which states: \n\n\n  § 73.1217 Broadcast hoaxes. \n  No licensee or permittee of any broadcast\n  station shall broadcast false information concerning a crime or a\n  catastrophe if:\n  \n  (a) The licensee knows this information is false;\n  \n  (b) It is forseeable that broadcast of the information will cause\n  substantial public harm, and\n  \n  (c) Broadcast of the information does in fact directly cause\n  substantial public harm.\n  \n  Any programming accompanied by a disclaimer will be presumed not to\n  pose foreseeable harm if the disclaimer clearly characterizes the\n  program as a fiction and is presented in a way that is reasonable\n  under the circumstances.\n\n\nImportant context is included in the accompanying note, which states: \n\n\n  For purposes of this rule, “public harm” must begin immediately, and\n  cause direct and actual damage to property or to the health or safety\n  of the general public, or diversion of law enforcement or other public\n  health and safety authorities from their duties. The public harm will\n  be deemed foreseeable if the licensee could expect with a significant\n  degree of certainty that public harm would occur. A “crime” is any act\n  or omission that makes the offender subject to criminal punishment by\n  law. A “catastrophe” is a disaster or imminent disaster involving\n  violent or sudden event affecting the public.\n\n\nEDIT: Addition:\n\nMore helpful context may come from Sec. 4 of this law review article and you may find the article in general, about criminalizing false speech on social media, interesting: https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/assets/articlePDFs/v31/31HarvJLTech65.pdf\n",

This applies not only to \"news agencies\", but also churches, social-media platforms, politicians and activists, and the wingnut who lives down the street. It also applies to scientific journals, which may be relied on by the scientific community to determine what is true. You have noted that there are certain limits on false or unproven claims in very specific contexts, in particular relying on laws passed by Congress under the Commerce Clause (no false advertising...).\n\nMisinformation has put lives at risk for centuries, a fact that was well-understood by the Founders and Framers. For this reason, the First Amendment precludes the development of a governmental Truth Bureau which decides what is true and what false or misleading statements are to be punished. Instead, the expectation is that all sides have an equal right to make claims about the truth. There are other means of persuading the majority of which statements are true and to be adhered to.\n",

Until recently, it's been only a minor annoyance.\n\nBut since things have been locked down due to the coronavirus outbreak, I've been spending a lot more time at home, and the traffic on the parkway has gotten lighter, meaning that at least anecdotally speeds have increased. The result is a huge increase in infrasound. It's like my whole apartment is shaking all day.\n\nI'm obviously not expecting the state to shut down traffic on the road completely for my comfort. It does seem like a reasonable expectation that the people driving on a roadway should get at least close to the legal speed limit, however. The posted speed on the road is 30 miles per hour, while drivers routinely flout this going 60 or 70 miles per hour.\n\nI've already tried writing to my city government, who referred me to a state agency who hasn't written back. I've also contacted the person who represents me in my state legislature. His office too has not written back to me.\n\nWhat's the most effective way to get my argument to a decision maker?

    "answer_id": "49215",
    "answer": "Questions about whether a certain action is \"just\" tend to be maters of opinion, politics and philosophy, but it can be addressed from the perspective of legal theory (especially following the model of common law, where legal principles are based on concepts of just and proper action). Whether or not a certain action is actually legal in a certain jurisdiction depends on the laws of that country -- I suspect that the answer is different for the US versus China.\n\nThe first question would be whether those government officials have the legal authority – I assume they do. Such authority is generally governed by some specific circumstances, for example, \"poses an imminent and grave threat to public health\". It is basically not a legal question whether quarantining in the face of this viral threat is necessary from a public health perspective, that is a medical question. What the law would say is that if this is a serious threat, then a person's liberty can be curtailed to a limited extent, because a person does not have the right to harm others because they don't want to do some thing that protects the rights of others (be vaccinated, stay in quarantine until it is safe). However, principles of legal justice also say that the government's response should be proportionate, e.g. shoot-on-sight in response to a sneeze is not proportionate. \n\nQuarantining has long been recognized as a valid, just and legal response to such extreme medical threats. Historically speaking, quarantining used to be the only effective action that a government can take against e.g. smallpox, plague, Spanish flu, Ebola.\n",

They are subject to reasonable restrictions as to time, place and manner, especially if those restrictions are content neutral. \n\nRestrictions narrowly tailored to protect against genuine threats public health and safety fall within the exception of the First Amendment even if they are not strictly content neutral, that is commonly described by the rubric that you don't have a right to falsely cry \"fire\" in a crowded theater (causing a riot that could harm people). \n\nFor example, suppose that a rope bridge over a deep gorge can only support the weight of ten people, and three dozen people want to hold a protest there. A regulation that prohibited more than ten people from engaging in the protest would be constitutional.\n\nEven then, however, a lack of content neutrality (e.g., restricting punishment to false statements likely to incite a riot) can't also be a lack of ideological neutrality (e.g. restricting punishment to anti-Catholic but not anti-Jewish statements likely to incite a riot).\n\n\n  If it were a political protest/gathering would this change?\n\n\nGenerally speaking political protest/gatherings are still subject to content neutral regulations of time, place or manner, and those narrowly tailored to protect genuine threats public health and safety.\n\nSo, for example, if there is a genuine COVID-19 risk that public health officials are trying to address, and the regulation of gatherings is not viewpoint or content based, it would be upheld as constitutional in the face of a First Amendment freedom of assembly limitation.\n\nBut, if the regulation applied, for example, only to Republican and not Democratic party protests or gatherings, which is a viewpoint or content based restriction, it would not survive a First Amendment freedom of assembly challenge. \n",

The US prohibits  and regulates pathogen experimentation (self-infection). There are also rules regarding shipping and export (ITAR).  Furthermore, in the US, there are (FL, NY state) laws that prevent patients from being tested unless the order is given by an authorized health care professional.  Hopefully, you do live in a state that does not have this regulation (AZ).\n\nWhile I do believe in one's right to do as one sees fit with one's own body, there is the counter-argument: there must be limits when it comes to unnecessarily exposing the community to pathogen risk.  I hope that this question is theoretical and that nobody actually believes the immunity supposition without a credible peer-reviewed scientific publication.  Unfortunately we live in an age where misinformation is propagated at novel speed and scale.\n\nI wish the OP well.  That being said, I have concerns regarding the underlying assumptions of the question.  While I am comfortable with the OP question, the underlying assumptions give me great pause.\n\nUPDATE\n\nIMHO: I hope that no reader will seriously consider amateur experimentation in self-infection in the hope of conferring immunity. Giving a pathogen uncontrolled safe-haven to propagate and possibly infect others seems irresponsible.\n\nI doubt that the government cares if any individual manages to puts themselves in an early grave, however, it does care if amateurs create an unnecessary pandemic risk.

Police forces do sometimes make ex gratia payments or pay compensation following such damage, for example where the raid was at the wrong premises. However, statutory guidance states that compensation for such damage is “unlikely to be appropriate if the search was lawful, and the force used can be shown to be reasonable, proportionate and necessary to effect entry.” Where a police force refuses to make such a payment, then a constituent wishing to pursue the matter further would need to obtain specialist legal advice.\n\n\nHowever, if a person wishes to press the issue, s/he can always sue the police.\n\n\n  The Police Powers page on the Citizen’s Advice website gives the following very general information about suing the police:\n  \n  \n    If your complaint is serious, you may wish to sue the police. You can sue the police in the same way that you can sue members of the public. If you want to sue the police, you should talk to a specialist solicitor.\n  \n\n\nUnited States\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 sets forth some parameters for suing law enforcement officials.\n\n\n  Under Section 1983 damages can take the form of nominal damages, compensatory damages and punitive damages.\n  \n  \n  Compensatory Damages may include lost earnings, loss of earning capacity, out of pocket expenses, pain/suffering, mental anguish and emotional distress suffered. There is no inherent “value” in constitutional rights. Damage awards for 1983 actions, separate and aside from normal tort standards, may not be based on the abstract “value” or “importance of constitutional rights\" There may, however, be inferred damages, which arise in situations where the circumstances themselves surrounding the violation imply actual damages.\n  Punitive Damages may be assessed when the defendant’s conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected right. Punitive damages may be found even when the underlying threshold for liability is recklessness. Municipalities are immune from punitive damages.\n  Injunctive Relief may be awarded.\n  Nominal Damages may be awarded by the jury if they determine that the plaintiff's Constitutional rights were violated but they do not believe that they suffered substantive damages.\n  \n\n\nHowever, the person must prove that their rights have been explicitly violated. This is often difficult to do.\n\nTwo cases of interest are Cody v. Mello and Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents. The latter has been widely used alongside 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to support the idea that people can be compensated for damages.\n\nIn any case, to gain damages, a person must bring a civil suit to court. It may or may not be successful, depending on the circumstances.\n",

    "question": "Recently I put down a holding deposit for an apartment I intend to move into next month (April 1). However, with the spread of COVID-19, moving in 2 weeks' time could be risky, or potentially impossible if I am quarantined. And, I don't know how many months I could be quarantined for.\n\nRegarding the holding deposit, I was told: \n\n\nit's nonrefundable if we are approved (we were)\nthis deposit would be treated as part of our security deposit\n\n\nUnfortunately I did not think to get a receipt or any of this in writing. I was clear that my move-in date would be April 1, and may have included this in my application. If they refuse to push forward my move-in date due to COVID-19, do I have grounds to receive my deposit back?\n\nI haven't signed a lease yet.

    "answer_id": "49928",
    "answer": "No.\n\nForce majeure does not change contract terms (e.g. making a non-refundable deposit refundable). Rather, it allows parties to get away with not performing their obligations where circumstances beyond their control prevent them from doing so.\n\nIn your situation, all parties have performed their obligations so far. You paid the required deposit, they welcome you on the 1st of April.\n\nIt would therefore be much more likely that they get away with not refunding you a refundable deposit (if there was one) because of COVID-19 — than you get back the non-refundable one.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "Probably not\n\nAssuming that the landlord is ready, willing and able to give you access to the property then they have fulfilled their contractual obligation regardless of if you can move in on that date. The apartment is available for your use; it's not your landlord's problem that you can't use it.\n\nIt would appear that there are two contracts here: the one where you paid the holding deposit in return for them holding it - this contract would appear to be complete. If you choose not to follow through with the second contract - actually leasing the premises; then that would not affect the contract that has already happened.\n\nThe concept of Force Majeure is not applicable here: both parties appear to be able to fulfill their contractual obligations even if you are quarantined - them to have the apartment available, you to pay the rent. The fact that you can't get the benefit of the contract is not a Force Majeure event. That's even assuming the contract deals with Force Majeure because, in common law jurisdictions, war, famine, pestilence, death and any other horsemen of the apocalypse you care to name do not relieve you of your contractual obligations.\n",

    "question": "We are witnessing the financial and personal repercussions of the spread of the corona virus that originated in Wuhan. It seems that the virus started spreading possibly as early as mid-November with the Chinese government trying to hide/downplay/minimize the issue at hand. Given the Chinese government failure to:\n\n\nPrevent the sale of raw animal meat and enforce the necessary sanitary measures to avoid human contact with raw meat.\nAllowing farming and selling of wild animals, which was than corrected later by issuing a law banning such sales, thus admitting the problem.\nProperly contain the spread in Wuhan by acknowledging the alarm calls of the local doctors and first signs that an unknown strain of corona virus was circulating.\n\n\nIs it possible for governments and private companies, I imagine only the most powerful ones, to sue the Chinese government to seek financial compensation for the damages occurred worlwide?\n\nI imagine that if a private company would accidentally leak a virus outside a lab, such company would be liable for all damages, why is a government not liable for any damage in this case? Can, theoretically, Chinese or citizens from other countries sue the Chinese government for the loss of loved ones?\n",
    "answer_id": "49933",
    "answer": "The main problem is that there is no court with authority to hear this case outside of China. It may be futile to sue in US courts, since China will not enforce US judgments. You can sue a Chinese company in Chinese court, under their Civil Procedure Law, but this pertains to contract breach. The question is whether there is any law under which the government of China can be sued for negligence – it is unlikely that that is possible (perhaps there is an expert in Chinese law here who can address that issue).\n\nThis lawsuit is filed in US courts. It is based on the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. Supposing that this lawsuit is successful in US courts, then the question is what enforcement actions are possible. Since the defendants are various governments and government agencies in China, execution of the judgment would have to be against those defendants – you can't seize the assets of every person with some connection to China. But given the nature of the Chinese government, it is possible that US courts could find that the assets of Chinese companies are effectively government assets.\n\nThe short answer is, in fact a lawsuit has been filed, and I expect more. I also don't expect them to succeed in the long run.\n",

    "question": "Several counties in California have issued a shelter in place order due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For example, see a Santa Clara’s order here.\n\nThe order states that individuals have to shelter in place. However, it lists multiple exceptions. If a police officer or other authority empowered to enforce this law asks you why you are outside, do you have to tell why you are outside or does the officer have to have reasonable suspicion you are in violation of the shelter in place order in order to detain you? This seems to be in violation of the concept that exercising your rights does not give grounds for reasonable suspicion or probable cause. Does an officer need probably cause that you are in violation of the order to arrest you? Or is it assumed that if you do not tell the officer what you are doing outside then your behavior is in violation of the order?\n",
    "answer_id": "49945",
    "answer": "The principle of constitutional law is that in order to arrest you, the officer would need probable cause. Certain acts are in themselves violations of the order (being closer to another person that 6 feet, illegal sneezing). Walking in public does not per se constitute a violation. In order to briefly stop a person walking on the street (a \"Terry stop\"), the officer needs a reasonable suspicion that the person is in violation of the law. That means there has to be a reason, and a gut feeling does not count. An officer would not (legally) be able to stop every person they see walking down the street / driving, and demand an explanation of where they are going.

    "title": "What effect does an event like the current Covid-19 pandemic have on contractural obligations?",
    "question": "Across the world, the current pandemic, and various government responses to it will impact on parties abilities to perform their obligations under a contract. \n\nWhat are the legal implications of this?\n",
    "answer_id": "50119",
    "answer": "Force Majeure\n\nAn event like the current Covid-19 event is what is known as a force majeure event; a Latin term meaning \"superior force\". It refers to an event that is beyond the control of the parties to a contract such as war, civil disturbance, acts of God and disease.\n\nCommon law jurisdictions\n\nIn common law jurisdictions (most of the English-speaking world), force majeure is not a legal doctrine but a creature of the particular contract. That is, the extent to which a contract does or doesn't deal with such events is the extent to which such events apply to that particular contract. For example, a construction contract may specify that a contractor is responsible for the care, protection and reinstatement of the works unless damage is caused by war. So, if the damage is caused by war the principal bears the risk but if it's caused by, say, flood, the contractor bears the risk.\n\nIf a contract is silent on the matter (in general or in the specific) then the parties obligations remain unchanged by the event and failure to comply is a breach of contract. For example, absent a provision in a contract, in the current pandemic:\n\n\nif a supplier is contracted to supply a component that was made in a foreign country and that cannot now be sourced from there; they will be in breach of their contract if they do not supply it. If it can be sourced from a local manufacturer at twice the price of the foreign source then that is the contractor's loss.\nif a company is contracted to provide engineering services and their staff cannot travel (either because they are sick or because of government restrictions) then they will be in breach of their contract and the principal can seek damages.\nif a construction contractor is obliged to finish by a given date and the government closes all construction sites, they will be in breach if they do not complete by that date notwithstanding.\n\n\nThese may seem to be unjust outcomes but, at the end of the day, somebody in the contract has to carry the cost of force majeure events and the development of the common law has left it for the parties to decide who. That is, at the time of negotiating the contract, the law allows that if the parties wanted to consider the risks of say, a pandemic, and spell out whose risk that was, they were free to do so and if they didn't that's their own fault - in the absence of such allocation, the parties must do what the contract says they must do. Common law jurisdictions have traditionally not seen it as the role of government to interfere in the details of private contracts.\n\nCommon law has a much narrower doctrine of frustration but this requires that the principal purpose of the contract be impossible to perform, not merely harder or more expensive to perform. Even much harder or much more expensive.\n\nCivil law\n\nIn civil law jurisdictions (continental Europe with their ex-colonies and most of Asia), force majeure is a legal doctrine. \n\nIt is a defence to liability where the defendant:\n\n\nhad nothing to do with the event - this pandemic would fit,\nis unpredictable - it is not certain that the pandemic was unpredictable. There have been pandemics before and many organisations around the world exist specifically to respond to them. Lest this seems needlessly pedantic, there have been cases decided that because a flood occurred 69 years ago, this flood was predictable; similarly, an avalanche 50 years ago rendered this one predictable. If predictable, then the defendant is obliged to have prepared for it.\nThe consequences must have been unpreventable.\n\n\nSo, even though it exists in civil law it is not a get out of jail free card.\n\nInternational law\n\nThe UNIDROIT Principles encompass force majeure as follows:\n\n\n  Non-performance by a party is excused if that party proves that the non-performance was due to an impediment beyond its control and that it could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or overcome it or its consequences. \n\n\n \n",

    "answer_id": "50545",
    "answer": "Regarding Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, details can be found on the Commission website. According to the table of all notifications, they all periodically invoke the “security  situation  in  Europe  and  threats  resulting from the continuous significant secondary movements”. This is obviously in blatant contradiction with article 25 but in practice that doesn't matter. You cannot find anything in there foreseeing unlimited extensions because there isn't. It's as simple as that, no sophisticated legal wizardry is involved (regarding the fate of Juncker's 2017 proposal: that limit hasn't changed since the current framework was introduced in 2013 and is still present in the June 2019 consolidated version of the Borders Code).\n\nBy contrast, France's strategy is to ignore the law entirely (as opposed to merely ignoring some specific clause of article 25): introduce quasi-systematic checks on some borders, don't try to create half-hearted legal justifications, don't notify the Commission or invoke some generic “persistent terrorist threat” applying to all borders and count on the Commission to carefully avoid challenging France on this. Back in 2015, the country suffered a string of deadly terrorist attacks and ultimately activated a state of emergency so that it had already invoked the right to reintroduce border controls and did not need any additional notification when the refugee crisis worsened.\n\nThe table on the Commission's website gives some additional insight into how all this came to pass. Back in 2015, many countries invoked article 28 with rather specific justifications related to the increasing number of refugees entering the Schengen area. After this initial unilateral move, the Council issued three recommendations to give these countries some legal cover (November 2016, February 2017, and May 2017) while roughly following the letter of article 25 (no more than six-month extension at once, not more than two years of border controls in total). Meanwhile, the Commission initiated a “Back to Schengen” strategy to try to salvage open borders in the Schengen area and make sure they appeared to be in charge.\n\nBut in reality, the countries in question were clearly intent on imposing checks no matter what, even if it was not possible to find some other face-saving legal basis. So when the last six-month period expired, they stopped being so specific and just reverted to a generic notification while everybody else turned a blind eye.\n\nNote that the Commission does have a tool to enforce these rules and force a member state to, at the very least, make an effort to offer a more detailed legal rationale for its actions: infringement proceedings. For a long time, rules pertaining to the “Area of freedom, security and justice” were subject to different rules but since 2014, it falls under the ordinary EU law regime. The Commission has however been very shy in launching infringement proceedings on such a politically sensitive topic.\n",

    "question": "I have been an employee at the company for over 5-year and I had requested time off work (4-months) to do sabbatical with some travelling. It was granted by my line manager. The request was made in person and then finalised in email.\n\nHowever, fast-forward to now and due to the coronavirus pandemic, I have had to return home early from my travels, at great financial cost. As such, I am keen to start working again as soon as possible and can do so from home with ease. FYI, before leaving I was working from home once a week anyway!\n\nI having had a call with my line manager, he says it won't be possible to return before the original return date, almost 2-months away.

When I pressed him on why, I was told my pay wasn't in the budget for April and due to corona they were already down in their P&amp;L.\n\nHowever, the UK government is willing to reimburse companies pay 80% of people's wages if the coronavirus has stopped them from working, so this seems a weak reason.\n\nEither way, this leaves me in a very strange situation: I am employee but I am not being payed.\n\nTherefore my questions are as such:\n\n\nCan my company legally stop me from returning to work, if it is not from something such as illness, etc?

This is a temporary situation: your employment does not end, but you may not be paid as there is no work for you to do. A person who is laid off may be entitled to statutory guarantee pay.\n\nA furlough is essentially the same thing as a lay off, although the term has become significantly more popular during the COVID-19 pandemic. Government guidance states that\n\n\n  If you and your employer both agree, your employer might be able to keep you on the payroll if they’re unable to operate or have no work for you to do because of coronavirus (COVID-19). This is known as being ‘on furlough’.\n\n\nThe government furlough scheme, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, has brought the term to greater attention, and this offers 80% of an employee's wages while they are under furlough.\n",

The underlying issue is that trademark protection does not give a person absolute ownership of certain words, it restricts how that may be used in a commercial context. If you were to start tweeting \"Buy great computers from me here: #AppleComputers lulz!!\" then there would be a reasonable case that readers could think you were selling Apple Computers, which could confuse the poor dears. There is this thing called the \"Rogers test\", from Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875 F.2d 994 which essentially says that in an expressive work, you can't use a trademark in a way that has \"no artistic relevance to the underlying work\" or if it \"explicitly misleads as to the source or the content\": that's a lesser restriction than the \"confusion\" test, which is the standard commercial speech test. (It must be pointed out that all of the test cases where \"fair use\" was found are in fact varieties of commercial speech, such as a movie, various publishing companies -- but the typical (?) social media use of hashtag is pure personal expression).\n\nAs for \"who decides\", well, The Law decides; this is embodied in a set of instructions read and somewhat selected by the judge and somewhat selected by his superiors; then the jurors try to understand what that means and apply it to the testimony, and answer a bunch of questions culminating in a verdict. And then is someone is unhappy, they can sue on some basis, so another bunch of judges get to make the final determination (or they could decide to avoid the case).\n",

    "answer": "\n  Can a shopowner in Thailand ban someone from entering their shop on the grounds of their citizenship?\n\n\nThe first tweet, explains the context properly: \n\n\n  I’m at my local hospital this afternoon to get a medical certificate. My work permit expires soon and so I need to run around getting all the documents in order. At the hospital they wanted to check my passport before letting me in to see if I had been abroad recently. \n\n\nThailand has been very popular with visitors for decades and if laws existed that discriminated against foreigners this would be commonly known. \n\nSo in this case the 'discrimination' probably not because of citizenship, but more about a faulty assumption that the virus is spread by foreigners. This will have nothing to do with Thai law.\n\nThe (tweet) OP quotes only another persons claim. The OP states in the first tweet that they checked his passport only to see if he was abroad recently. So he didn't share the same experience of the American. Based on that, this second hand source (that can't be verified) is probably unreliable. \n\nDue to the present (global) uncertainties, caused by the Coronavirus, one should look at the whole picture. \n\n\n  2020-02-04: Coronavirus: Chinese targeted as Italians panic - BBC News\n  In Italy and elsewhere, panic is spreading much faster than the coronavirus itself. Chinese businesses are empty, shopkeepers are shutting down and Chinese nationals are being targeted.\n  \n  \n  At a bar beside the Trevi fountain, a notice was put up banning customers from China.\n  \n\n\nSo the the situation described by the original (tweet)  OP is understandable, but the quoted (but not varified) second hand source as well as the events in Italy are not. \n\n\n  The incidents have prompted condemnation from the Italian authorities.\n  Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte reprimanded the regional governors, telling them that they were not competent to make such a call and that nothing justified such fear.\n\n\n\n\nDiscrimination, solely due to citizenship, would be against Human Rights prevention of discrimination. \n\nSpecial cases may exist for prices that are subsidized and thus only for residents. \n\nDual pricing was common in the Czech Republic until 1999, when it was ruled illegal (but still persisted). Then a foreign resident had to supply proof of residency to avoid paying the higher price. 2007: Illegal practice of dual pricing persists in Czech Republic \n\nAt the time we assumed that this was legal (it was certainly understandable), but it seems that was not the case.  \n\n\n\n\n  Are the \"Human Rights prevention of discrimination\" written down somewhere?

    "wrong_answer": "At a minimum, what the theater did was not a crime. When you are in a movie theater you have what is called a \"license\" from the theater to be present, which is revocable at will without due process (possibly subject to breach of contract damages) and not a property right to be in the theater the way that a tenant who must be evicted does.\n\nAs a practical matter, given that the amount in controversy is, at most, $25 or so, and this is not a situation where the prevailing party would get their attorneys' fees, this is not cost effective to litigate, regardless of who is correct, even in small claims court without an attorney.\n\nWhether or not the theater breached its contract isn't perfectly clear, because usually, the contract between a movie goer and a movie theater is not spelled out in any writing provided to the movie goer, incorporated by reference in something disclosed to the movie goer, or signed by either of the parties, or even with an oral offer and acceptance setting forth all of the terms of the agreement. (Of course, if a written terms of service is actually provided to the movie goer, or a reference to where it can be found is provided to the movie goer, those terms will control and the contract will almost certainly be written to allow the movie theater to do what it did in this case.) In the frequent case where this is not done, the contract between a movie goer an a movie theater is usually a contract implied in fact whose terms at the edges aren't terribly well defined and there is little case law to tell us what the terms of the contract is, because the cases aren't worth litigating up to an appellate court where binding precedents are made.\n\nIndeed, one reason that movie theaters may have declined to put their implied in fact contracts with movie goers in writing is to leave the situation ambiguous so as to discourage someone whose case would be clear even if for a small dollar amount, if the terms of the contact were clear, from suing them over issues like this one. When the stakes are small and the outcome is always uncertain, it almost never makes sense to sue.\n\nThere is certainly a colorable argument that you breached the contract by being present without an adult at an R-rating movie when the public statements about an R rating made available to the movie goers says that rated R means only admitted with a person over the age of 17, contrary to the theater's policies on that issue, although it isn't perfectly clear if this is a suggestion or a binding term of the agreement.\n\nAnother fair interpretation of the contract between a movie goer and the movie theater is that a movie goer can be removed from any movie whenever, if in the reasonable opinion of the movie theater management, good cause exists to do so, and that its discretion should be upheld so long as it acts in good faith and in a non-discriminatory manner.\n\nI don't agree, however, that the question of whether or not you breached a contract was unambiguously clear, because the terms of the agreement are not well defined. I would give you at least a 20% chance of prevailing if you took the issue to court although I would agree that it is more likely than not that you would not prevail if you took the issue to court.\n",

Further, even if there was such a clause, it would need to capture Covid-19 within the definition of Force Majeure either by defining it sufficiently broadly or by naming “pandemics” a one type of Force Majeure event.\n\nEnglish law has the much narrower doctrine of frustration but that requires that the supervening event becomes impossible, not just more onerous or expensive. It doesn’t apply here.\n\nIt’s also possible for a contract to have a change of law clause - this would probably apply to Covid-19 since the proximate reason for your work stopping is likely a government regulation. However, these are generally worded to allow the payee to recover additional costs of complying with the law, not to reduce the payer’s obligations. Notwithstanding, I’m guessing that your contract doesn’t have one of these either.\n\nIn your case you are required to keep paying and the have the scaffold removed before the deadline or you will be in breach and liable for damages.

    "answer": "Yes, do use household dilute H2O2 but, in general, do not use commercial percarbonates powders as they can contain an additive to convert the friendly percarbonate into more powerful Peracetic acid (PAA). The latter allows the otherwise weak bleaching power of the H2O2 to compete with chlorine-based bleaching. However, this comes at a price (safety). Hence, the dire warning labels, usually in at least two languages, on Oxi-Bleach and generic related products.\n\nI quote myself on this subject:\n\n\n  Sodium percarbonate is chemically just an addition compound of Na2CO3 and Hydrogen peroxide.\n  \n  Also, while Sodium carbonate and Sodium percarbonate (basically Na2CO3 and 3Na2CO3.2H2O2) are often listed as the main ingredients in typical chlorine free bleach, an additive, TAED, which acts as a key activator (see, for example) is not even listed on the label. TetraAcetylEthyleneDiamine is apparently commonly employed as a bleach activator in many laundry products (see this).  TAED reacts with H2O2 in alkaline conditions (referred to as perhydrolysis) creating, in part, Peracetic Acid. The latter PAA is actually preferred over sluggish H2O2 for bleaching. In other words, it is not the H2O2 as the active bleaching agent, but PAA created in situ.  So, other than possibly misleading implying that eco friendly hydrogen peroxide is the active agent, it is, in reality, PAA, a probematic compound with associated  health concerns (see Marquand, E. C.; et al. , 2007. \"Asthma Caused by Peracetic Acid-Hydrogen Peroxide Mixture\". J. Occup. Health. 49 (2): 155–158.). Here is a MSDS on an actual PAA mix ( 76-61% water, PAA 20-35%, 3% Acetic acid and 1% H2O2) available at which is far from friendly but does eventually totally decompose into harmless O2, CO2, H2O,...\n  \n  As such anyone using a commercial percarbonate product should at least be aware of safety issues and that one is likely employing a Peracetic acid mix.\n\n\nHowever, such more powerful PAA based mixtures do have their use and is recommended by the U.S. Military as a chemical/biological warfare decontamination protocol (see \"Development of Bicarbonate-Activated Peroxide as a Chemical and Biological Warfare Agent Decontaminant\"). So, it is up to the user to weigh the relative risks of the situation.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "I did find a work, 'Electrolyte Engineering toward Efficient Hydrogen Production Electrocatalysis with Oxygen-crossover Regulation under Densely Buffered Near-neutral pH Conditions', with comments of interest. \n\nI start with some background from the introduction:\n\n\n  In recent decades, drastic progress in solar fuel production has occurred: photovoltaic cells can generate electricity from the sunlight,[1−4] whereas photoelectrochemical [5] and photocatalytic [6−11] water splitting can directly produce hydrogen and oxygen by harvesting the sunlight. An electrolyzer can electrochemically split water molecules,[12,13] which can be conjugated with the photovoltaic cells.[14,15] Importantly, during the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic water splitting, what takes place on the surface is electrocatalysis, in association with the photonic processes at the bulk of photon absorber and the interface between the photon absorber and electrocatalyst.[11] Electrocatalysis will thus certainly play a crucial role in the solar fuel production process in the future. \n\n\nAnd further concentration-related statement taken from the abstract, where HER refers to the hydrogen evolution reaction:\n\n\n  The choice of electrolyte in terms of its identity and activity drastically altered the HER performance. Electrolyte properties (activity coefficient, kinematic viscosity and diffusion coefficient) accurately described the mass-transport contribution, which was easily isolated when a highly active Pt catalyst was used. The HER rate on the Pt was maximized by tuning the solute concentration (typically 1.5 – 2.0 M). Moreover, the kinematic viscosity and oxygen solubility under such densely buffered conditions governed the oxygen mass-transport flux in the electrolyte, which in turn tuned the cross-over flux. At near-neutral pH, as high as 90% selectivity toward the HER was achieved even under an oxygen saturated condition, where only a 40 mV overpotential was needed to achieve 10 mA cm−2 for the HER. This information can be regarded as an important milestone for achieving a highly efficient water splitting system at near-neutral pH. \n\n\nOf potential interest are associated graphs, starting with Figure 1, on Page 31, to Figure 9.\n",

    "question": "I did asked before , but apparently providing a link to a science report of harmless for humans (both skin and eyes) far-UV light was not enough to make people understand the significance of the solution to the raging COVID-19.\nSo this link (please read a bit of it):\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w\nSays that the UV light of wavelength 222 nanometers (the photons bounces off the skin and the eyes) is absolutely harmless and do not make neither skin cancer or cataract. So this light is deadly for viruses and is not commercially available to anyone like ordinary humans (perhaps only some labs got it but sure cannot by on amazon or ebay or so). So if you wish to protect people you ideally need something to kill the virus in mid-air exactly as this lamp does.\nCite: \"By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207–222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin.\" - this line is at the beginning of the link above.\nSo my idea is to help ordinary people that have some DIY experience to make a lamp and disinfect the clothes and themself like skin and face and face mask and so.\nSo a guy good in chemistry of similar that ca help with his knowledge and experience to help the people and get rid of the virus.\nThe research I did in the internet says that the UV has ability to kill virus in 10 seconds.\nSo having a lamp emitting harmless 222nm UV light instead the cancer deadly 254nm UV germicidal lamps will be able to protect from the diseases.\nThe question is how to make it.\n\nso I suppose you can type a good way to do it and save the half of the western world population (the old people like your grandma and grandpa)?\n\n(Nobody needs glass (or quartz) blowing of a lamp.

    "answer_id": "129061",
    "answer": "UVC is very harmful to people and requires specialist equipment to create and use safely\n\nYou are not going to be able to create or use lamps that emit 222nM light without specialist equipment, and even if you could it would almost certainly not be safe.\n\nFar UV lamps are widely commercially available for germicidal applications and these usually use mercury vapour fluorescent discharge tubes with no phosphors so have a strong emission around 250nM from a line in the mercury emission spectrum. They are very dangerous to people and have caused significant harm when used accidentally (see this video from BigClive describing what happens when they are used accidentally instead of the much less harmful \"black light\" tubes commonly used for discos and events). \n\nAnother important fact to bear in mind is that UVC lamps of this type have to use specialist glass in manufacture because common types of glass strongly absorb UVC wavelengths. So, while they are readily available, they are not easy for an amateur to make.\n\nYou report a claim from a Nature paper than a tightly controlled UVC light of around 222nM wavelength is not harmful to people. I would be far more cautious as the Nature paper did not do extensive safety studies on the actual effect on people and given what we know about wavelengths not much longer, the claim would need some extensive validation.\n\nBut you have bigger problems than this in your pursuit of an easy-to-make solution accessible to amateurs. First, you cannot easily get around the problem of the glass used absorbing the wavelengths you want to see: you will need specialist material. Second, the actual excimer lamps as used in the nature paper are sophisticated devices that cannot easily be made by non-specialists (they are far more complex than the relatively conventional discharge tubes used in commercial UV lamps which are essentially the same as conventional visible fluorescent lamps apart from the need for specialist glass). Apart from anything else the lamps have a strong emission at around 258nM, exactly the wavelength known to be very dangerous to people from simple UVC mercury vapour lamps. The NAture paper reported using specialist narrow band filters to eliminate those wavelengths. These are unlikely to be easy to obtain. Third, creating the excimer lamps is a sophisticated process requiring specialist pulsed electronic drivers to get the lamp to work (most likely, according to this reference in the Nature paper, you need to fine tune the gas mixture and the pressure and the driving electronics for the lamp which is far more complex than a simple driver for a fluorescent tube).\n\nAnd, as for \"Nobody needs glass (or quartz) blowing of a lamp\", I'm afraid you are delusional. You need specialist glass to let the right wavelengths through and specialist filters to kill the harmful wavelengths. This is not \"simple DIY\".\n\nYou have seen an interesting paper in Nature and assumed it is easy for someone to make in their shed. This is not true. Specialist skills are required and attempting anything without those skills is likely highly dangerous (and that is ignoring the issues of handling the chemicals and vacuum technology needed to create the lamp: both are dangerous). \n\nAnd, perhaps more importantly, the best way to avoid contamination of others with covid-19 is to wash your hands. There are no easy technological silver bullets here, though, perhaps, professional engineers and chemists can build something safe based on the Nature observation in the future.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "Perhaps you can add H2S to create PbS (as a starting step). Then, based on an extract from Wikipedia on Lead Sulfide:\n\n\n  Although of little commercial value, PbS is one of the oldest and most common detection element materials in various infrared detectors.[12] As an infrared detector, PbS functions as a photon detector, responding directly to the photons of radiation, as opposed to thermal detectors, which respond to a change in detector element temperature caused by the radiation. A PbS element can be used to measure radiation in either of two ways: by measuring the tiny photocurrent the photons cause when they hit the PbS material, or by measuring the change in the material's electrical resistance that the photons cause. Measuring the resistance change is the more commonly used method. At room temperature, PbS is sensitive to radiation at wavelengths between approximately 1 and 2.5 μm. This range corresponds to the shorter wavelengths in the infra-red portion of the spectrum, the so-called short-wavelength infrared (SWIR). Only very hot objects emit radiation in these wavelengths.\n\n\nsome ideas. Perhaps examining a comparative study (based on known concentrations of Pb) of the changed in measured electrical resistance of a sample of PbS suspension taken from the solution after treating with the same volume of H2S followed by irradiation may provide a path. This not meant to be a complete answer, but a suggestion on a possible path to be explored.\n\n[EDIT] To be clear, I am assuming that one cannot measure light absorbance, due to lack of equipment, for the purpose of establishing Pb concentration. But, one can perhaps measure electrical resistance. The question is can one construct a path (actually, more likely a graph to which a curve is fitted) to determine Pb concentration from the change in electrical resistance recorded upon applying a fixed amount of infrared radiation to a solution where varying amounts of PbS is introduced. If experimenting with known starting Pb concentrations, converted to PbS, suggests a detectable and measurably path with some degree of goodness-of-fit, then yes, else no (which is the only answer provided so far).\n\nHere is some background on PbS based photodetectors where irradiation exposure varies and the amount of PbS concentration remains fixed.\n\n\n  PbS is a standard SWIR semiconductor detector (1 - 3.3 µm) whereas PbSe is used in the MWIR range (1 - 4.7 µm when uncooled; up to 5.2 µm when cooled). Our lead salt detectors are photoconductive; the detector resistance is reduced during illumination. The crystal structure is polycrystalline and is produced via chemical deposition.\n\n\nPlease note the actual size of the PbS based photodetector. \n\nNote, my proposed study of feasibility avoids the use of a nephelometer (which can measure the concentration of some inert suspended particulates in say a liquid colloid by employing a light 'source' beam and a second light detector at 90° to the source beam) by taking advantage of the properties of irradiated PbS particulates. Also, it should be noted that a spectrophotometer, based on a quantitative measurement of the reflection or transmission properties of a material as a function of wavelength, based again on light, is also presumably not an available option.\n\n[EDIT EDIT] Just found a reference, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE AND DISPERSED PHASE CONCENTRATION IN OIL IN WATER EMULSIONS to quote:\n\n\n  The electrical resistance of a series of oil‐in‐water emulsions has been measured, and used to test the validity of four equations relating resistance with the concentration of dispersed phase. A modification of one of the equations was found to give the best relationship.\n\n\nIn the current context, we have a suspension of irradiated PbS in water (releasing electrons, per this 2013 article 'Photoinduced electron transfer from PbS quantum dots to cobalt(III) Schiff base complexes: light activation of a protein inhibitor'), which I would have guessed is more promising in determining the PbS concentration than say of oil in a water emulsion. \n\nAlso found a new method to quote a source:\n\n\n  In summary, we have demonstrated a practical way to measure nanoparticle concentration in a colloidal solution using quartz crystal microgravimetry. Application of a small drop of the nanoparticle colloid in a volatile organic solvent to the crystal surface leaves a dry nanoparticle film after solvent evaporation. Crystal resonant frequency shifts obeyed Sauerbrey’s equation for the dry nanoparticle concentrations up to 1300 µg/mL, as calibrated using a set of serial dilutions of Si and Ag nanopowders in methanol, rhodamine B in methanol, and ferrocene in cyclohexane.\n\n",

Thus, you can just simply go about finding the total n moles of Argon and carbon dioxide through PV=nrt.\n\nSo, 1.72 (1.72L) / 0.08206 x (273 + 17) = 0.1243 total moles. Subtract 0.06869 moles from earlier from 0.1243. You will get 0.055356 moles of CO2. Now, you can use your partial pressure method.\n\nHope this helps.\n",

    "answer": "There are several points that you can improve in the code \n\nWrong boundary conditions\n\nYour model is fixed to I=1 for time zero. You can either changes this point to the observed value or add a parameter in the model that shifts the time accordingly.\n\ninit &lt;- c(S = N-1, I = 1, R = 0)\n\n# should be\n\ninit &lt;- c(S = N-Infected[1], I = Infected[1], R = 0)\n\n\nUnequal parameter scales\n\nAs other people have noted the equation  \n\n$$I' = \\beta \\cdot S \\cdot I - \\gamma \\cdot I$$\n\nhas a very large value for $S \\cdot I$ this makes that the value of the parameter $\\beta$ very small and the algorithm which checks whether the step sizes in the iterations reach some point will not vary the steps in $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ equally (the changes in $\\beta$ will have a much larger effect than changes in $\\gamma$). \n\nYou can change scale in the call to the optim function to correct for these differences in size (and checking the hessian allows you to see whether it works a bit). This is done by using a control parameter. In addition you might want to solve the function in segregated steps making the optimization of the two parameters independent from each others (see more here: How to deal with unstable estimates during curve fitting? this is also done in the code below, and the result is much better convergence; although still you reach the limits of your lower and upper bounds)\n\nOpt &lt;- optim(c(2*coefficients(mod)[2]/N, coefficients(mod)[2]), RSS.SIR, method = \"L-BFGS-B\", lower = lower, upper = upper,\n         hessian = TRUE, control = list(parscale = c(1/N,1),factr = 1))\n\n\nmore intuitive might be to scale the parameter in the function (note the term beta/N in place of beta)\n\nSIR &lt;- function(time, state, parameters) {\n  par &lt;- as.list(c(state, parameters))\n  with(par, { dS &lt;- -beta/N * S * I\n  dI &lt;- beta/N * S * I - gamma * I\n  dR &lt;- gamma * I\n  list(c(dS, dI, dR))\n  })\n}\n\n\nStarting condition\n\nBecause the value of $S$ is in the beginning more or less constant (namely $S \\approx N$) the expression for the infected in the beginning can be solved as a single equation:\n\n$$I' \\approx (\\beta \\cdot N - \\gamma) \\cdot I $$\n\nSo you can find a starting condition using an initial exponential fit:\n\n# get a good starting condition\nmod &lt;- nls(Infected ~ a*exp(b*day), \n           start = list(a = Infected[1],\n                        b = log(Infected[2]/Infected[1])))\n\n\nUnstable, correlation between $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$\n\nThere is a bit of ambiguity how to choose $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ for the starting condition. \n\nThis will also make the outcome of your analysis not so stable. The error in the individual parameters $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ will be very large because many pairs of $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ will give a more or less similarly low RSS. \n\nThe plot below is for the solution $\\beta = 0.8310849; \\gamma = 0.4137507 $\n\n\n\nHowever the adjusted Opt_par value $\\beta = 0.8310849-0.2; \\gamma = 0.4137507-0.2$ works just as well:\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a different parameterization\n\nThe optim function allows you to read out the hessian\n\n&gt; Opt &lt;- optim(optimsstart, RSS.SIR, method = \"L-BFGS-B\", lower = lower, upper = upper,\n+              hessian = TRUE)\n&gt; Opt$hessian\n            b            \nb  7371274104 -7371294772\n  -7371294772  7371315619\n\n\nThe hessian can be related to the variance of the parameters (In R, given an output from optim with a hessian matrix, how to calculate parameter confidence intervals using the hessian matrix?). But note that for this purpose you need the Hessian of the log likelihood which is not the same as the the RSS (it differs by a factor, see the code below).\n\nBased on this you can see that the estimate of the sample variance of the parameters is very large (which means that your results/estimates are not very accurate). But also note that the error is a lot correlated. This means that you can change the parameters such that the outcome is not very correlated. Some example parameterization would be:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{}\n c &amp;=&amp; \\beta - \\gamma \\\\\n R_0 &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}\n\\end{array}$$\n\nsuch that the old equations (note a scaling by 1/N is used):\n\n$$\\begin{array}{rccl}\nS^\\prime &amp;=&amp; - \\beta \\frac{S}{N}&amp; I\\\\\nI^\\prime &amp;=&amp; (\\beta \\frac{S}{N}-\\gamma)&amp; I\\\\\nR^\\prime &amp;=&amp; \\gamma &amp;I\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nbecome\n\n$$\\begin{array}{rccl}\nS^\\prime &amp;=&amp; -c\\frac{R_0}{R_0-1}  \\frac{S}{N}&amp; I&amp;\\\\\nI^\\prime &amp;=&amp; c\\frac{(S/N) R_0 - 1}{R_0-1} &amp;I&amp; \\underbrace{\\approx c I}_{\\text{for $t=0$ when $S/N \\approx 1$}}\\\\\nR^\\prime &amp;=&amp; c \\frac{1}{R_0-1}&amp; I&amp;\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nwhich is especially appealing since you get this approximate $I^\\prime = cI$ for the beginning. This will make you see that you are basically estimating the first part which is approximately exponential growth. You will be able to very accurately determine the growth parameter, $c = \\beta - \\gamma$. However, $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$, or $R_0$, can not be easily determined.\n\nIn the code below a simulation is made with the same value $c=\\beta - \\gamma$ but with different values for $R_0 = \\beta / \\gamma$. You can see that the data is not capable to allow us differentiate which different scenario's (which different $R_0$) we are dealing with (and we would need more information, e.g. the locations of each infected individual and trying to see how the infection spread out).\n\nIt is interesting that several articles already pretend to have reasonable estimates of $R_0$. For instance this preprint Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: early estimation of epidemiological parameters and epidemic predictions (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549)\n\n\n\n\n\nSome code:\n\n####\n####\n####\n\nlibrary(deSolve)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\n\n#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2019%E2%80%9320_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak#Cases_Chronology_in_Mainland_China\nInfected &lt;- c(45, 62, 121, 198, 291, 440, 571, 830, 1287, 1975, 2744, 4515)\nday &lt;- 0:(length(Infected)-1)\nN &lt;- 1400000000 #pop of china\n\n###edit 1: use different boundary condiotion\n###init &lt;- c(S = N-1, I = 1, R = 0)\ninit &lt;- c(S = N-Infected[1], I = Infected[1], R = 0)\nplot(day, Infected)\n\nSIR &lt;- function(time, state, parameters) {\n  par &lt;- as.list(c(state, parameters))\n  ####edit 2; use equally scaled variables \n  with(par, { dS &lt;- -beta * (S/N) * I\n  dI &lt;- beta * (S/N) * I -

This is shown in the image below where the model is plotted not only for the number of infected people but also for the number of recovered people. It is such information (as well additional data like detailed information where and when the people got infected and with whom they had contact) that allows the estimate of $R_0$.\n\n\n\nUpdate\n\nIn your blog article you write that the fit is leading to a value of $R_0 \\approx 2$. \n\nHowever that is not the correct solution. You find this value only because the optim is terminating early when it has found a good enough solution and the improvements for given stepsize of the vector $\\beta, \\gamma$ are getting small. \n\nWhen you use the nested optimization then you will find a more precise solution with a $R_0$ very close to 1. \n\nWe see this value $R_0 \\approx 1$ because that is how the (wrong) model is able to get this change in the growth rate into the curve.\n\n\n\n###\n####\n####\n\nlibrary(deSolve)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\n\n#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2019%E2%80%9320_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak#Cases_Chronology_in_Mainland_China\nInfected &lt;- c(45,62,121,198,291,440,571,830,1287,1975,\n              2744,4515,5974,7711,9692,11791,14380,17205,20440)\n#Infected &lt;- c(45,62,121,198,291,440,571,830,1287,1975,\n#              2744,4515,5974,7711,9692,11791,14380,17205,20440,\n#              24324,28018,31161,34546,37198,40171,42638,44653)\nday &lt;- 0:(length(Infected)-1)\nN &lt;- 1400000000 #pop of china\n\ninit &lt;- c(S = N-Infected[1], I = Infected[1], R = 0)\n\n# model function\nSIR2 &lt;- function(time, state, parameters) {\n  par &lt;- as.list(c(state, parameters))\n  with(par, { \n    beta  &lt;- const/(1-1/R0)  \n    gamma &lt;- const/(R0-1)  \n    dS &lt;- -(beta * (S/N)      ) * I \n    dI &lt;-  (beta * (S/N)-gamma) * I \n    dR &lt;-  (             gamma) * I\n    list(c(dS, dI, dR))\n  })\n}\n\n### Two functions RSS to do the optimization in a nested way\nRSS.SIRMC2 &lt;- function(R0,const) {\n  parameters &lt;- c(const=const, R0=R0)\n  out &lt;- ode(y = init, times = day, func = SIR2, parms = parameters)\n  fit &lt;- out[ , 3]\n  RSS &lt;- sum((Infected_MC - fit)^2)\n  return(RSS)\n}\n\nRSS.SIRMC &lt;- function(const) {\n  optimize(RSS.SIRMC2, lower=1,upper=10^5,const=const)$objective\n}\n\n# wrapper to optimize and return estimated values\ngetOptim &lt;- function() {\n  opt1 &lt;- optimize(RSS.SIRMC,lower=0,upper=1)\n  opt2 &lt;- optimize(RSS.SIRMC2, lower=1,upper=10^5,const=opt1$minimum)\n  return(list(RSS=opt2$objective,const=opt1$minimum,R0=opt2$minimum))\n}\n\n# doing the nested model to get RSS\nInfected_MC &lt;- Infected\nmodnested &lt;- getOptim()\n\nrss &lt;- sapply(seq(0.3,0.5,0.01), \n       FUN = function(x) optimize(RSS.SIRMC2, lower=1,upper=10^5,const=x)$objective)\n\nplot(seq(0.3,0.5,0.01),rss)\n\noptimize(RSS.SIRMC2, lower=1,upper=10^5,const=0.35)\n\n\n# view\nmodnested\n\n### plotting different values R0\n\nconst &lt;- modnested$const\nR0 &lt;- modnested$R0\n\n# graph\nplot(-100,-100, xlim=c(0,80), ylim = c(1,6*10^4), log=\"\", \n     ylab = \"infected\", xlab = \"days\")\ntitle(bquote(paste(\"scenario's for different \", R[0])), cex.main = 1)\n\n### this is what your beta and gamma from the blog\nbeta = 0.6746089\ngamma = 0.3253912\nfit &lt;- data.frame(ode(y = init, times = t, func = SIR, parms = c(beta,gamma)))$I\nlines(t,fit,col=3)\n\n# plot model with different R0\nt &lt;- seq(0,50,0.1)\nfor (R0 in c(modnested$R0,1.07,1.08,1.09,1.1,1.11)) {\n  fit &lt;- data.frame(ode(y = init, times = t, func = SIR2, parms = c(const,R0)))$I\n  lines(t,fit,col=1+(modnested$R0==R0))\n  text(t[501],fit[501],\n       bquote(paste(R[0], \" = \",.(R0))),\n       cex=0.7,pos=4,col=1+(modnested$R0==R0))\n}\n\n# plot observations\npoints(day,Infected, cex = 0.7)\n\n\nIf we use the relation between recovered and infected people $R^\\prime = c (R_0-1)^{-1} I$ then we also see the opposite, namely a large $R_0$ of around 18:\n\nI &lt;- c(45,62,121,198,291,440,571,830,1287,1975,2744,4515,5974,7711,9692,11791,14380,17205,20440, 24324,28018,31161,34546,37198,40171,42638,44653)\nD &lt;- c(2,2,2,3,6,9,17,25,41,56,80,106,132,170,213,259,304,361,425,490,563,637,722,811,908,1016,1113)\nR &lt;- c(12,15,19,25,25,25,25,34,38,49,51,60,103,124,171,243,328,475,632,892,1153,1540,2050,2649,3281,3996,4749)\nA &lt;- I-D-R\n\nplot(A[-27],diff(R+D))\nmod &lt;- lm(diff(R+D) ~ A[-27])\n\n\ngiving:\n\n&gt; const\n[1] 0.3577354\n&gt; const/mod$coefficients[2]+1\n  A[-27] \n17.87653 \n\n\nThis is a restriction of the SIR model which models $R_0 = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}$ where $\\frac{1}{\\gamma}$ is the period how long somebody is sick (time from Infected to Recovered) but that may not need to be the time that somebody is infectious.

    "wrong_answer": "There are a few issues here, but I fear that the interpolation error of integration may be the least of them.\n\nTo start, if this work is done in a regulatory context one must use whatever procedures are required. So if there are regulatory requirements for how to estimate integration error then those take practical precedence. What follows ignores such regulations. First we'll examine the situation when the cost estimates have little or no error at the indicated event probabilities, then discuss how uncertainties in the costs and in other aspects of the modeling affect the estimated values of defenses at specified standards of protection.\n\nIf costs are known precisely\n\nWhat you have displayed are the limits of the possible cost-probability curve if you know that the cost curve is non-increasing with increasing x-axis (probability) values. In this case that seems to be a reasonable assumption, as lower-probability events (higher flood stage) should have costs at least as large as higher-probability events (low or no flood stage).\n\nThe integrals estimated by the blue and red lines are Riemann sums, with the blue line providing a left Riemann sum and the red line a right Riemann sum. Your proposal to use those as outer limits for the inteterpolation error itself seems quite appropriate.\n\nIn general for smooth curves, the trapezoidal rule (which you presumably are using for your integration estimate, and is the average of the left and right Riemann sums) has a defined relationship between the integration error and a value of the second derivative of the cost-probability curve somewhere within the limits of integration. So if you can assume reasonable limits for the second-derivative values, that could set limits to the integration error. For the direction of systematic error, if you can assume that the curve is convex you know that your interpolation will over-estimate the true area.\n\nConvexity and limits on second-derivative values might, however, not be good assumptions for flood costs. For example, there could be a fairly fast jump in costs as flood stage reached the level of first-story floors, and then another jump as flood stage reached the level of second-story floors. So convexity and assumptions about limits on second-derivative values would be questionable. That could also make it risky to try to fit a smooth curve to the set of data pairs and calculate the area analytically from the equation for the smooth curve.\n\nSo if the costs are known precisely then the limits you propose seem to be the best you can get in general for the limits of the area under the curve between the specified x-axis limits. \n\nWith uncertainty in the costs\n\nEstimating integration error due to interpolation does not deal with an additional source of uncertainty: the uncertainty in the y-axis cost estimates. A statistician would want to see error estimates for each of those cost values and would want you to take those error estimates into account to get a better measure of the actual error in your estimate of the value of the integral.\n\nThis is a particular problem with flood damage prediction. The x-axis probabilities typically represent the probability per year of a flood that is greater than a specified level (stage) above normal water levels. The damage associated with a particular stage may be affected by other aspects of the flood besides its level, such as its velocity or duration, adding additional uncertainty to damage estimates at any flood stage. This report compares different approaches to estimating flood risk; some simply ignore the uncertainties in stage and cost, some sample from probability distributions for certain of these estimates, and some model with event-based catastrophe models instead of continuous probability estimates.\n\nThis answer shows how errors in the estimates of y-axis values affect the estimates of integrals interpolated by the trapezoidal rule, in situations where the errors of the values at different event probabilities are uncorrelated. This simply follows the rules for variance of a weighted sum.\n\nTo get an idea of the relative contributions of interpolation and imprecise cost estimates to overall integration error, consider the integral under the curve between two event stages with cumulative probabilities (x-axis values) $p_0$ and $p_1$ ($p_0 &lt; p_1$; $p_1-p_0=\\Delta p$), having associated costs of $C_0$ and $C_1$ ($C_0 &gt; C_1$).\n\nInterpolation error. The trapezoidal rule gives an area $ (C_0 + C_1) \\Delta p /2$. The upper limit of area given by the left Riemann sum is $C_0 \\Delta p$, for an upper-limit difference for error above the trapezoidal estimate of $(C_0-C_1)\\Delta p /2$.\n\nErrors in $C_i$. If the variances of the $C_i$ values are $\\sigma_i^2$ and the $C_i$ are uncorrelated, then the trapezoidal interpolation has an associated variance of $(\\sigma_0^2 + \\sigma_1^2)\\Delta p^2/4$, or a standard error of $\\sqrt{(\\sigma_0^2 + \\sigma_1^2)}\\Delta p/2$.\n\nSo if the curve is relatively steep compared to the errors in the cost estimates then the interpolation error of the area will dominate. Areas over comparatively flatter parts of the curve, perhaps typical of higher-probability stages, may have integration errors dominated by the errors in the cost estimates. Similar application of the formula for the variance of a weighted sum provide the errors in the left and right Riemann sums that you propose as upper and lower estimates of integration error per se.\n\nOther uncertainties in modeling\n\nThe full cost/benefit comparison involves more than estimating the annual benefit of installing the defense. This report shows how discount rates (to translate future gains into net present values) and expected project life are also incorporated into the calculation. There is the possibility that past history of flood probabilities does not adequately represent the future. Furthermore, future development (or abandonment) of structures in the flood plain will affect the value of installing the defense. Uncertainties in any of these estimates will add to the uncertainty in the full cost/benefit comparison.\n",

But I want to find a way to calculate it even if it requires assigning dummy/guesswork numbers for unknown probability. Where do I begin?\n",
    "answer_id": "453797",
    "answer": "First of all,\n\nThe computation is very theoretic and not a good representation or guideline for adapting your behavior (just in case, if that is what you are after). In the comments I had already mentioned several points of critique for this approach:\n\n\nThe problem is that these computations will be based on highly subjective estimates about the underlying model/assumptions. Yes, you can compute it.... But do not expect that the answer is rigorous just because it has used mathematics\nAnother problem is that the descriptions of contacts are very complex. How exactly are you gonna be in the description of the 'time of contact'? Are you differentiating just the time of contact or also the type of contact? It is not a deterministic model and you need to deal with with distributions and stochastic behaviour that will make computations more difficult.\n\nSee for example the report about transmission of SARS in airplanes: there were three cases described with an infected person on board. In one case tens of other passengers got infected. In the other two cases it was only one other person (a crew member) that got infected. \nIn addition, are you gonna describe the probability for a single person, or the probability for the public health? In high traffic the probability for a single individual might be low but due to the large number of individuals in those situations there might be a probability that at least one or more persons get infected. \n\nFor public health, the problem is not to compare cases based on the probabilities for individuals to become sick. But instead, the point is to reduce the probability for individuals spreading the virus, make others sick. In general those probabilities (to make others sick) are much higher with high traffic cases. Sick people should not be around many other people.\n\nThere are many of these strange probability effects around. For instance, in Europe there is a lot of focus on people who had contact with the high risk areas; and it seems to be ignored that one may acquire the virus locally as well.  \nIndeed, when considering only a contact with a single person, then it is more likely to obtain the virus if this person is from (or had contact with) a high risk area. However, due to the much larger number of contacts with people outside the risk area it may be more likely to acquire the virus from one of those people, albeit the fact that the risk per contact is lower.  Still, it is not illogical to focus on the high risk areas. But that is more a consideration from the point of view of focusing the limited time, money and materials. Yes, it is more likely to get the coronavirus from somebody that is not from the risk area's. But there are many other viruses from which one may obtain a common cold and we can not deal with all of those cases. When we wish to focus efforts on the most important cases, then the consideration is for which people the common cold is most likely to be due to the coronavirus. In that case it is linked to the high risk areas. \n\n\n\n\nA possible solution (based on a simple model),\n\nLet's consider the (unrealistic) probability of obtaining an infection, conditional on the other person being sick (this is a bit complex, there are different levels of being sick but let's consider this for single cases).\n\nSay, the probability 'to get sick from a single contact of time $t$' is a function of contact time according to some (sort of) homogeneous Poisson process (ie. the waiting time to get hit/sick depends on an exponentially distributed variable and the longer the contact the more likely to get sick) \n\n$$P(\\text{sick from contact time $t$}) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}$$\n\nIf you encounter $n$ people, each for a time $t$, sampled from a population of which $p\\%$ are sick...\n\n\nthen the number of sick people, $S$, that you encounter is binomial distributed $$P(S=s) = {{n}\\choose{s}} p^s(1-p)^{n-s}$$\nthe probability of getting sick from those $S$ people is: $$P(\\text{sick} \\vert t,s) = 1- e^{-\\lambda ts}$$\nthe marginal probability of getting sick is $$\\begin{array}{}\nP(\\text{sick} \\vert t, n) &amp; = &amp; \\sum_{s=0}^n\n\\overset{{\\substack{\\llap{\\text{probability}}\\rlap{\\text{ to encounter}} \\\\ \n\\llap{\\text{$s$ sick }}\\rlap{\\text{people}}  }}}{\\overbrace{P(S=s)}^{}}\n \\times \\underset{{\\substack{\\llap{\\text{probability to  }}\\rlap{\\text{get sick}} \\\\ \\llap{\\text{conditional}} \\rlap{\\text{ on}} \\\\ \\llap{\\text{encountering $s$}} \\rlap{\\text{ sick people}}\n}}}{\\underbrace{P(\\text{sick} \\vert t,s)}_{}} \\\\ \\\\\n&amp;=&amp; 1- \\sum_{s= 0}^n {{s}\\choose{n}} p^s(1-p)^{n-s}e^{-\\lambda ts} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 1- \\left(1- p + pe^{-\\lambda t}\\right)^n \n\\end{array}$$ where I solved this last term with wolframalpha.\n\n\nNote that \n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} 1- \\left(1- p + pe^{-\\lambda t/n}\\right)^n = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t p} $$\n\nFor a given fixed total contact  $C = n\\times t \\times \\lambda$ you get an increase as function of $n$. For instance, if $C = 10$ then:\n\n\n\nIntuitive overview\n\nBelow are two graphs that show the value of this term $1- \\left(1- p + pe^{-\\lambda t}\\right)^n $ as function of contact time $t$ and number of contacts $n$. The plots are made for different values of $p$.\n\nNote the following regions:\n\n\nOn the right side the contact time is very large and you are almost certainly gonna get infected if the person that you have contact with is sick. More specifically for the lower right corner (if $n=1$ and $t$ is very large) the probability of getting sick will be equal to $p$ (ie. the probability that the other person is sick). \nMore generally for the right side, the region where $\\lambda t&gt;1$, a change in the contact time is not gonna change much the probability to get sick from a single person (this curve $1-e^{-\\lambda t}$ doesn't change much in value for large $\\lambda t$).\n\nSo if $\\lambda t&gt;1$ (and you are almost certainly getting sick if the other person is sick) then if you halve the contact time and double the number of contacts, then this is gonna increase the probability to get sick (because the probability to encounter a sick person increases).\nOn the left side for $\\lambda t &lt; 1$ you will get that at some point an increase of $n$ with an equal decrease of $t$ will counter each other. On the left side it doesn't matter whether you have high traffic short time vs. low traffic high time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, say you consider total contact time $n\\times t$ being constant, then this should lead to a higher probability for getting sick for higher $n$ (shorter contacts but with more people). \n\nLimitations\n\nHowever the assumptions will not hold in practice. The time of contact is an abstract concept and also the exponential distribution for the probability of getting sick from a single person is not accurate.\n\n\nPossibly there might be something like contact being more/less intense in the beginning (to compare in the simple model the probability to get sick from a single contact of time $t$ is approximately linear in time $1-e^{\\lambda t} \\approx \\lambda t$)\nAlso when considering infections of groups, instead of individuals, then there might be correlations like when a sick person sneezes then it will hit multiple people at the same time. Think about the cases of superspreaders, e.g. the case of the SARS outbreak in the Amoy Gardens apartment complex where likely a single person infected hundreds of others)\n\n\nSo based on the simple model there is this effect that of for a given total time of contact, $n \\times t$, is better to spread it out among less people, $n$. \nHowever, there is an opposite effect. At some point, for short $t$, the transmission will be relatively unlikely. For instance, a walk on a busy street means high $n$ but the contacts will not be meaningful to create a high risk. (Potentially you could adapt this first equation $1 - e^{\\lambda t}$ but it is very subjective/broad). You could think like something as the '5 seconds rule' (which is actually not correct but gets close to the idea).\n\nUse of the simple model\n\nAlthough the model used here is very simplistic, it does still help to get a general idea about what sort of measures should be taken and how the principle would work out for a more complex model (it will be more or less analogous to the simple model): \n\nOn the right side (of the image), it doesn't help much to change (reduce) the contact time, and it is more important to focus on reducing the number of contacts (e.g. some of the rigorous advise for non-sick family-members that are in quarantine together with sick family members are not much useful since restricting $\\lambda t$ for large $\\lambda t$ has little effect and it would be better to focus on making less contacts; go cook yourself instead of ordering that pizza)\n\nOn the left side, reductions should be weighed against each other. When restrictions that reduce high traffic are gonna lead to low traffic but a longer time then the measures are not gonna help a lot. \n\nA very clear example: I am currently waiting in line to enter the supermarket. They have decided to reduce the number of total people inside the supermarket. But this is entirely useless and possibly detrimental. The total time that we are in contact with other people does not decrease because of this. (And there are secondary effects: partners alone at home with children that have to wait longer. Potential shopping at multiple markets because time is limited at single markets. Etc. It is just silly)\n\nI am letting the older people in the line pass before me since the health effects may be worse for them. And in the meantime I make myself annoyed about this symbolical useless measure (if not even detrimental) and have sufficient time to type this edit in this post, and in the meantime either make other people sick or become sick myself.\n",

If so, then I think you would want \"score ~ service + (1|school/trial) + (1|school/trail:service)\" - that gives you a fixed main effect for service, and a random effect for the interaction of service with trial-nested-within-school.\n\nThe answer above assumes service is categorical. If service is continuous, you will need a random slope for the interaction instead of random intercepts, eg. \"score ~ service + (1|school/trial) + (service|school/trail)\". This is not an interaction in the sense that you'll get an output value, but it does account for differing effects of service (as a continuous variable) in different trial-nested-within-school groups.\n\nFor more information on interactions with lmer, these slides may be helpful.\n",

There are loads of test statistics you can construct and test to try to reject the null hypothesis of i.i.d. samples, but unless you guess the mechanism of the dependence correctly or have a huge sample size, such statistics (like you describe in your problem) can have very low power.\n\nIf $U_1,U_2,\\ldots,U_n$ are \"random\" integers, you could do a chi-square test of independence on sequences of a given length $k$. Then you've got $n-k$ observed sequences, and each should occur with probability $10^{-k}$.\n\nSuppose you have some a priori knowledge of the dependence; for instance, you suspect that an adversary is trying to make the sequence look independent to the human eye, and so they make sure every number in the sequence is different from the last. Then using $k=2$ in the previous paragraph will uncover the dependence, because the 10 \"doubles\" will never appear in the sequence and the chi-square test for independence will reject. But if the dependence mechanism is something else, this test may not pick it up.\n",

    "question": "I am asking this question because I believe it would be great if the statistics community could make a contribution to solving this serious puzzle until more evidence is available. \n\nThe UK Royal Office of Obstetricians and Gynecologists publishes guidelines on neonatal and prenatal treatment of Corona positive women and babies of Corona positive women. There is insufficient evidence to give an advice whether breastfeeding is safe in the sense of not passing virus from mother to child via the mother milk. There are other infection ways but mother milk could be expressed and fed while keeping distance, e.g. by father.\n\nA source is quoted in the guidelines (p. 27) that 6 Chinese women's breast milk was tested Corona negative; that is, six of out six samples were negative. If we consider these tests independent events, where the event is to sample a woman who passes the virus via the mothermilk, we have a binomial trial.\n\nWhich confidence or credibility statements can we make about the probability to pass on the virus to the mother milk? This probability is estimated at zero in this trial, of course. \n\nSome statements can be made; for example if the probability was 0.50 the likelihood of the data would be 0.015. If it approaches 0, the likelihood approaches 1, but it is not differentiable at zero, so standard likelihood inference fails.\n\nPlease note: The same guidelines advise in section 4.8.2 to continue breastfeeding by COVID-19 positive women: ' In the light of the current evidence, we advise that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. The risks and benefits of breastfeeding, including the risk of holding the baby in close\nproximity to the mother, should be discussed with her.' (p. 27)\n",

You can then treat the years as if they were just data points, and select the testing sets totally randomly. You can do e.g. 3-fold crossvalidation by splitting the data in 3 randomly selected set of years, run the model 3 times (see how N-fold cross-validation works), and then put together all the 3 independently predicted testing sets from those 3 models and evaluate them with the Nash-sutcliffe coefficient, which seems to be a good measure of the model efficiency.\n\nChose the model with the best coefficient. Cross-validation assures  that you do not overfit in those single models tested.

    "answer": "One of the differences is the likelihoods for each model.  In case readers can't remember, the likelihood encapsulates assumptions about the conditional distribution of the data.  In the case of COVID-19, this would be the distribution of infections (or reported new cases, or deaths, etc) on the given day.  Whatever we want the outcome to be, let's call it $y$.  Thus, the conditional distribution (e.g. the number of new cases today) would be $y\\vert t$ (think of this as $y$ conditioned on $t$).\n\n\nIn the case of taking the log and then performing lm, this would mean that $\\log(y)\\vert t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu(x), \\sigma^2) $.  Equivalently, that $y$ is lognormal given $t$. The reason we do linear regression on $\\log(y)$ is because on the log scale, the conditional mean is independent of the variance, where as the mean of the log normal is also a function of the variance. So Pro: we know how to do linear regression, but Con This approach makes linear regression assumptions on the log scale which can always be assessed but might be hard to theoretically justify?  Another con is that people do not realize that predicting on the log scale and then taking the exponential actually biases predictions by a factor if $\\exp(\\sigma^2/2)$ if I recall correctly.  So when you make predictions from a log normal model, you need to account for this.  \nSo far as I understand, nls assumes a Gaussian likelihood as well, so in this model $ y \\vert t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta t), \\sigma^2)$.  Except now, we let the conditional mean of the outcome be non-linear.  This can be a pain because no confidence intervals are not bounded below by 0, so your model might estimate a negative count of infections.  Obviously, that can't happen.  When the count of infections (or whatever) is larger, then a Gaussian can justifiable.  But when things are just starting, then this probably isn't the best likelihood.  Furthermore, if you fit your data using nls, you'll see that it fits later data very well but not early data.  That is because misfitting later data incurrs larger loss and the goal of nls is to minimize this loss.\nThe approach with glm frees is a little and allows us to control the conditional distribution as well as the form of the conditional mean through the link function. In this model, $y \\vert t \\sim \\text{Gamma}(\\mu(x), \\phi)$ with $\\mu(x) = g^{-1}(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1)$.  We call $g$ the link, and for the case of log link $\\mu(x) = \\exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 t)$. Pro These models are much more expressive, but I think the power comes from the ability to perform inference with a likelihood which is not normal.  This lifts a lot of the restrictions, for example symmetric confidence intervals. The Con is that you need a little more theory to understand what is going on.\n\n",

In this case your outcome will be two numbers: the x and the y coordinate.\nYour approach would require multi-class classification and one way to encode the outcome would be as a one-hot encoded matrix.\n\nIf there are many source and destination values, then the curse of dimensionality is a valid concern. Some algorithms are designed to handle many categorical dimensions, e.g. catBoost. The underlying idea here is to replace each level in the categorical variable by a noisy average of the target variable for that level. That turns a categorical variable into a single continuous variable.\n\nThe other state-of-the-art approach is use separate input layers for categorical variables in a neural network, a model structure know as embedding (layers). The embedding layer reduces the large dimensionality into a lower dimensional representation that serves as input to the prediction layer/linear model. This has been shown to be effective in a taxi competition on Kaggle \n\nEDIT: Twelve unique source destination are likely not an issue w.r.t dimensionality.

    "answer": "No, for a few reasons.  The most relevant is that, even if you could numerically determine the value of the intercept term in the model, you would not be able to tell what conditions are represented by the intercept term of the model fit by the researchers (unless they provided some very specific details about their methods, e.g., \"did they center their predictors\", etc.).\n\nThe way these models are defined, you need to know what the \"reference\" point of each coefficient is.  By convention the reference point for continuous variables is often zero, but the choice of reference is completely arbitrary for categorical variables (though it does appear to be stated in the article).\n\nOn a more conceptual note, models like this one are often limited in their ability to predict accurate \"class probabilities \"because their goal is to explain relationships between predictors, or to describe relative risk-reducing or risk-increasing relationships among the predictors in the model.  Often these models use only a limited number of variables to arrive at a parsimonious model, which tries to keep multicollinearity low, so that the individual effects of predictors are easier to interpret.  \n\nAnother way of looking at it is this:  The model may have been designed to address research questions  such as: \"what is the relative importance of age with respect to the risk of an in-hospital death after controlling for other demographic factors?\".  Even if the model does this very well, it may be very bad at answering fundamentally different questions, such as \"What is the probability that a female will experience an in-hospital death?\"\n",

My intuitive reasoning, as described below, shows why I am questioning the optimistic interpretation, but I would like to learn a more formalized framework.\n\n\n\nFor instance, let's say that the population proportion that tests positive for an attribute is 7%, and that proportion is stable. If I took a random sample each day, I should be getting 7% consistently, subject to some variance.\n\nHowever, let's say the population proportion is subject to change over time. Let's also add the assumption that I am trying to prioritize sampling people (without replacement) that I believe are most likely to be positive. Eventually I will sample the whole population. Under these new assumptions, if the population proportion were stable, you would expect my initial sample proportions to overshoot, and my final sample proportions to under shoot as I ran out of likely positives. That would imply that if my sample proportion was constant and did NOT drift down over time, then my population proportion MUST be increasing over time. And if my sample proportion was increasing over time, then my population proportion must be increasing by a heck of a lot over time.\n\nThese are just qualitative conclusions I can come to. Is there a branch of statistics I can learn about to help me make concrete conclusions about a changing population proportion given sample proportions over time?

    "answer": "It doesn't seem like the death toll is clearly showing up (yet). \n\nFor instance, Europe has almost up to 10 000 deaths in a single day during the peak of a heavy respiratory season, and the Covid-19 cases will only be a small bump, in relation to the overall burden of disease.\n\nBut, that would be playing down the impact of the virus. It is difficult to look at the overall death rate. Many people are dying every day. We can not easily compare a single cause to the total amount of deaths that are occurring.\n\nImportant to consider is that Covid-19 deaths have a non-homogeneous spatial distribution and locally there's a high density that's not clear in common (public) databases that (mostly) present aggregate numbers. Also, the outbreak is still young and is not yet fully processed in databases. So with better data we might be better able to see the impact of the disease (I suspect that the agencies have better information).\n\nSo the fact that we currently see little influence of Covid-19 on aggregated statistics of death rate is not reassuring because it is meaningless to look at aggregated statistics (this depends a bit on your philosophy about nature and death though, personally I feel we are overreacting, but that is completely different from statistics). \n\nSee also this note from EuroMomo\n\n\n  Note concerning COVID-19 related mortality as part of the all-cause mortality figures reported by EuroMOMO\n  \n  Over the past few days, the EuroMOMO hub has received many questions about the weekly all-cause mortality data and the possible contribution of any COVID-19 related mortality. Some wonder why no increased mortality is observed in the reported mortality figures for the COVID-19 affected countries.\n  The answer is that increased mortality that may occur primarily at subnational level or within smaller focal areas, and/or concentrated within smaller age groups, may not be detected at the overall national level. This even more so in the pooled European-wide analysis, given the large total population denominator. Furthermore, there is always a few weeks of delay in death registration and reporting. Hence, the EuroMOMO mortality figures for the most recent weeks must be interpreted with some caution.\n  Therefore, although increased mortality is currently not being observed in the EuroMOMO figures, this does not mean that increased mortality does not occur in some areas or in some age groups, including mortality related to COVID-19.\n\n",

    "wrong_answer": "Why are errors correlated in the reduced-form VAR?\nIf the error covariance matrix were restricted to be diagonal in the reduced form, the model would be too restrictive to adequately represent most of real-world time series. You could specify such a restricted model, but the assumption of diagonal covariance matrix would often be violated in practice.\n\nWhy are errors uncorrelated in the structural VAR?\nStructural VAR with contemporaneous effects and uncorrelated errors is another representation of the same reduced-form VAR model. For convenience of interpretation, the structural representation is defined by lack of error correlation. Other representations with contemporaneous effects but correlated errors are possible but are less interesting. \n",

    "wrong_answer": "In fact, from the underlying processes that generate such a curve, it is better described by an Inverse Gausssian distribution. Indeed, this distribution arises when computing the distribution of the time to first passage of a Brownian motion. Consider each person in the population as accumulating every time step some \"risk factor\". Then, that person might be infected if that level crosses the infection threshold. This distribution is widely used in psychology or economics. \n\n\n\nNote that for certain values, it looks close to a Gaussian \"bell-shaped\" distribution. As a side note, mathematically, it is certainly not a Gaussian as the support for a Gaussian is the set of real numbers, while the variable you want to describe (\"time since first case\") is the set of positive reals. \n",

    "answer": "This is actually a handbook example of determining the sample size needed for estimating binomial proportion (e.g. Jones et al, 2004, Naing, 2003 for other references and examples).\n\nFirst of all, to make it more precise, we are talking about finding such sample size, that with probability $\\alpha$, the difference between the true probability of being infected $p$ and it's estimate $\\hat p$ is not greater then $(100\\times\\delta\\,)\\%$\n\n$$\n\\Pr(|p - \\hat p| \\le \\delta p) = \\alpha\n$$\n\nGiven that the target population is large, we would usually assume binomial distribution to represent it, i.e. we say that it is large enough, that the chance of randomly sampling someone more then once is negligible. The distribution is parametrized by probability of \"success\" (here, probability of being infected) $p$ and the number of samples we draw $n$. Let's denote the observed number of infected people as $k$, in such case, $\\hat p = k/n$ is the fraction of infected people in the sample and we treat it as an estimate of the number of infected people in the whole population. If we wanted to calculate confidence interval for $\\hat p$, we could use normal approximation\n\n$$\n\\hat p \\pm z_\\alpha \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat p(1-\\hat p)}{n}}\n$$\n\nwhere $z_\\alpha$ is the ordinate from standard normal distribution, where for $z$ drawn from standard normal distribution we have $\\Pr(-z_\\alpha &lt; z &lt; z_\\alpha) = \\alpha$. You are saying, that you'd like to see this interval to be equal to $\\hat p \\pm \\delta p$. As discussed in the linked resources, you can solve this, so that for given $p$, precision $\\delta$, and certanity $\\alpha$, you can guesstimate the sample size needed\n\n$$\nn \\approx \\Big(\\frac{z_\\alpha}{\\delta p}\\Big)^2 \\; p(1-p)\n$$\n\nAssuming $(100 \\times \\alpha)\\% = 99\\%$ confidence interval, we can plot this for different values of $p$, to find out that for $100 \\times p &gt; 4 \\%$ the needed sample sizes are generally not much larger then $2000$ samples.\n\n\n\nFor example, for $p=0.04$ ($4\\%$ infected) this yields:\n\n\n\n&gt; z &lt;- function(alpha) qnorm(alpha)\n&gt; n &lt;- function(p, alpha=0.99, delta=0.25) (z(alpha)/(p*delta))^2 * p*(1-p)\n&gt; n(0.04)\n[1] 2078.167\n\n\nTo convince yourself, you can verify this by simulation, where you would draw $n$ samples from binomial distribution with probability of infection $p$, repeat this procedure $R$ times, and then verify how often was your result not further then $(100 \\times \\delta) \\%$ from the true value:\n\n&gt; set.seed(123)\n&gt; sim &lt;- function(p, n, delta, nsim=50000) mean(abs(p - rbinom(nsim, n, p)/n) / p &lt;= delta)\n&gt; sim(0.04, 2078, 0.25)\n[1] 0.97858\n\n\nSo we wanted to be $99\\%$ sure and the approximation gives us, while the in the simulation, in $97.8\\%$ cases the result was within the interval. Not bad.\n\nNotice that this is just a simple approximation for the calculation, assuming simple random sampling. In case of whole population locked in their houses, sampling individuals at random may be not as hard as in case of most of the usual surveys. On another hand, things may not go as smooth as planned, or you may be willing to use other sampling schema, to have higher chance for it being representative, what would make calculating it more complicated. Moreover, the tests used aren't perfect and give false results as described, for example by New York Times, or Washington Post, and you'd need to account for that as well. Also you need to remember, there were many examples where such simple problems get more complicated then expected, e.g. social surveys on Trump's support before the election got very wrong, nonetheless that they used state of art survey methodology.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "What you are seeing is exactly what one would expect. The condition number of your matrix $X$ is about $10^6$. Double precision floating point calculations give about 18 figures of accuracy so, in double precision, you would expect to get at most $18-6=12$ significant figures for the estimated coefficients from QR and at most $18-6-6=6$ significant figures from Choleski, after allowing for accuracy lost due to conditioning.\n(Choleski loses twice the number of significant figures because forming $X^TX$ squares the condition number.)\nHence the coefficients from the two algorithms should start to differ in the 6th significant figure, which is exactly what you see. Your results show that for x2 the relative difference between the two algorithms is about\n$$ 0.2 / 148232 = 1.35 \\times 10^{-6},$$\nwhich matches the condition number you started out with surprisingly well.\n\nThe condition number of $X$ is a reasonable guide to precision when the residuals are small.

If the fitted values are more important to you than the coefficients, and that will often be so in a highly collinear cases, then Choleski is usually fine.\nCholeski is also about as good as QR when the residuals are very large, but this is the hardest case for both algorithms.\nMy PhD supervisor was Australia's foremost numerical analysis (Mike Osborne) and he used to say that Choleski was not as bad as it's made out to be.\n\nThe full sensitivity analysis for Choleski vs QR is given in Section 5.3.8 of Golub and Van Loan (1996), and is very much more complex than the simple calculation I used above. The sensitivity of Choleski is roughly proportion to $\\kappa + \\rho \\kappa^2$ where $\\kappa$ is the condition number of $X$ and $\\rho$ is a theoretical quantity that is almost impossible to compute in practice.\n$\\rho$ depends on the size of the residuals-- it is roughly proportional to but much smaller than the average squared residual.\nThe sensitivity of QR is somewhat better than Choleski although not always as good as I have suggested above.

It looks a bit like how people solve equations with the finite element method and potentially you could solve it in that way as well (but it will be an approximation in terms of polynomial functions, and is not exact). \n\nAnother way to solve it is to put the equations as a function, and have some solver optimize it (you can have the solver estimate the gradient). You can read about that here: Fitting SIR model with 2019-nCoV data doesn&#39;t conververge\n\nIn addition: You can recast the equations into a single differential equation. For the SIR model this is demonstrated here:\n\nTiberiu Harko, Francisco S. N. Lobo, M. K. Mak  Exact analytical solutions of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model and of the SIR model with equal death and birth rates arXiv:1403.2160 [q-bio.PE]\n\nThe SIRD model is almost analogous. It is nearly the same model, with only the R split up in two. So you can use this differential equation to make initial estimates of parameters. \n\n\n\nAlso\n\nFitting this kind of data to some model might be a bad idea. The SIR type of models are some sort of logistic growth type models where the growth starts approximately exponentially but eventually the growth rate decreases. It is due to such terms like $dI/dt = I * (factor)$ where the factor is decreasing as $I$ (and $R$ and $D$) grow (in the case of logistic growth the factor is $1-I$, for the SIRD model it a bit more sophisticated but not much different).\n\nHowever, in the case of the corona epidemic, you get a decrease in the growth rate for a multitude of reasons.\n\n\nWeather changes ($R_0$ is not a constant)\nSpatial distribution (This virus spreads in from place to place, and should not be considered with compartmental models that assume homogeneous mixing; a person in Milan is much more likely to infect their family, neighbors, co-workers than a random person in the rest of Lombardy)\nStochastic Time effects. The article that you refer to tries to bring autocorrelation into the mixture, but you also have some stochastic behavior, people are not gonna get sick exactly at the same time. Some people will get sick earlier than others and this will be according to some function that increases in time and that will make an increase of cases or deaths that might appear as an exponential growth that relates to a transmission model, but it might be not. \nSampling bias. We can also see rapid increase in the sampling due to biassed sampling. Definitions of the disease are changing (this gave a rapid bump in the curve for Chinese), tests might be limited (several countries are limiting their testing which might give false ideas of reduction in the growth of the cases), positive reinforcement (once people have discovered the disease suddenly many other cases might become assigned to the same cause, and this may potentially occur inaccurate because a single cause of death is not always possible to assign)\n\nThe last to points Sampling Bias and Stochastic time behavior might have occured in the outbreak of SARS (2003) in Amoy Gardens where hundreds of people got sick in a very short time frame. Instead of fitting a model to it, one could also assume that all these hundreds of cases were infected by a single person (and that might be a more likely scenario). Possibly such a situation may have occurred in Italy as well, an initial heavy seeding by unnoticed cases that is now spreading with some time effect and causes the initial exponential decrease (currently the growth looks more like a quadratic curve).\nLast but not least, people respond to the virus which may cause it's spread to increase/decrease. Currently heavy measures have been taken and this restricts to a large extend the ability of the virus to spread. You can not model this with a model that has parameters that are constant in time (well, you can, but the outcome will be meaningless)\n\n\nThe logistic SIR type models will interpret all those reasons for a reduction in the growth rate as a reproduction rate very close to 1 or a low population parameter (you fixed it at the size of the population under study, but this is arbitrary, and also not everybody is gonna be susceptible, possibly many people might have some sort of immunity and get little infected, e.g. a Hoskin's effect or some other effect might make only/mostly the elderly population susceptible).\n\nThis makes the seemingly mechanistic model, meaningless regarding the parameters. The outcome will be unrealistic.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "What's happening is that R and Stata use quite different approaches to estimating the population standard deviation. R goes directly via the mean of $(X-\\bar X)^2$ and Stata goes via an estimated standard error of the mean (under simple random sampling). \n\nAs a result, Stata's estimate depends on values outside the subpopulation (as is unarguably correct for the standard error of the mean) and R's doesn't (as is at least arguably correct for the subpopulation standard deviation).  \n\nFor example, you can get the 2.198 in the Stata output as\n\n&gt; sqrt(2.47162^2*571.16/139.77*6/31)\n[1] 2.198105\n\n\nwhere 2.47162 is the R estimate, 571.16 is the estimated population size (sum of weights), 139.77 is the estimated subpopulation size (sum of weights), 6 is 7-1 and 31 is 32-1. \n\nAs you can see, it isn't easy to convert; it's probably easier to just implement the formula from the Stata manual if you want the Stata version.\n",

    "title": "How to analyze if a specific event caused an increase in coronavirus cases?",
    "question": "I'm going to post a question related to the current events and I think it could be very interesting.\n\nIn the midst of the crisis with the coronavirus, Croatian capital of Zagreb was hit by a strong earthquake on March 22. Since a lot of people escaped their homes in panic, there were fears that the earthquake would cause an increase in the cases of coronavirus since people didn't obey the rules of social distancing when they escaped outside due to the earthquake.\n\nThe Director of the Croatian Institute for Public Health, Krunoslav Capak, said that they conducted some preliminary analyses that suggest that the earthquake didn't cause an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. The analyses are preliminary becuase the incubation period of the virus is known to be as long as 14 days, so it's possible that the effect is not visible yet.\n\nRegardless of the incubation period length, I was confused by Capak's statement because I cannot think of a statistical method I would use to make that inference. Does anyone know what analyses was Capak referring to? What statistical analyses would be appropriate to determine if there was an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Croatia due to the earthquake?\n\nThe number of coronavirus cases in Croatia can be found here: https://github.com/viborccom/data/blob/master/covid-19/croatia/time-series.csv?fbclid=IwAR2ekRN44WnKwlTQJAgpfYyJTz01GedrqJupB28d-g_KoGBnroIGWt8Jb58\n",

    "answer": "You might wonder whether an increased infection rate during a short period could be observed in the figures of reports on infected cases or the death rate.\n\nHowever, this is not feasible with the data available\n\n\nThe effect get's diluted The effect is likely to be very small in the observations (unless the infection rate is very large). \n\n\nIf there is an increase in transmission then this will occur only in a small group, which gets diluted by the larger total number of Zagreb and the surroundings. \nAlso the time of the event is only very short and the contact between people is very local. Social distancing is 'the way to go', but it matters with which persons and how long you have contact. \n\nComplete strangers in a supermarket are much more a risk than your neighbors (if your neighbors got the virus than you are already at high risk to get the virus as well, being outside is not gonna change this a lot). There is a large multitude of ways how the virus can spread. If we are traveling a lot, moving around over long distances, then the virus is moving a large distance quickly and will infect a lot of people quickly. The local transmission is of less concern (in terms of speed of transmission, and flattening the curve, the local transmission is eventually determining how many people get sick. The long range transmission is determining how fast people get sick*).\n\nAd hoc ergo propter hoc Even if there is a change in the trend/growth in the number of infections or the number of death cases, then it will be very difficult to connect this observation to a specific event. There are too many variables that are changing such that it is not possible to draw strong conclusions about causal relationships based on correlations.\n\nThe current cases in Zagreb and Croatia are very small. So the number will be expected to rise, already without an earthquake. This rise will occur with lots of uncertainty**. The information and background information is so noisy that it is not possible to make a lot of sensible predictions.\n\nSee the past reports on the cases below. The curve is not a nice straight line and is varying in growth rate and bumpy. It is very difficult to make a specific relation between specific events and this curve. That is because the time between infection, start of symptoms, and start of registration/confirmation occurs with an unknown delay.\n\n\nTime delay Also, there is a delay in reporting of the numbers. This makes the above effects count stronger. It will take two weeks before the effect of increased transmission is measurable. But at that time many more events have happened which may cause an effect as well. And also the time delay is a random value. What happens now in a single day, will not create a sudden peak of a single day two weeks later, but instead it gets spread out over multiple days and becomes less noticeable (and then there are also large high noise levels in the measurements which might be a fourth point). \ndenominator. Furthermore, there is always a few weeks of delay in death registration and reporting. Hence, the EuroMOMO mortality figures for the most recent weeks must be interpreted with some caution.\n\n\n\n\n*A simple model that shows how the reduction in the long-range transmission is having a strong effect and going on the streets and have local community spread is slightly less worrisome. I used the code from this answer which made used of a $R_0$ for short distance transmission and a $R_1$ for long distance transmission. I did two computations, one with $R_1 = 0.25 , R_0 = 2.25$ and one with one with $R_1 = 0 , R_0 = 2.5$. The total reproduction rate, $2.5$, is the same, but the models deviate quickly once the infection reaches the edges of the neighborhood.\n\n**In the Netherlands the officials were counting on a very specific rise of cases in the Intensive Care. Now... they are surprised that it did not turn out to be that specific number and it is a larger number than predicted (they were expecting 1600 people in the Intensive Care at some date, and not this is gonna happen a week earlier than expected)\n\nMe... I am surprised that they are surprised about the number turning out to be different. These sort of predictions should have been made with a very wide confidence interval indicating that there is very little certainty about the forecasts.\n",

    "question": "0 Introduction\n\nThis is my third attempt in tuning a good prediction SIRD model for the COVID-19 outbreak. The model in question is the following:\n$$\\tag{12}\\begin{cases}\nS_{t}&amp;=S_{t-1}-\\alpha\\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N} \\\\ \nI_{t}&amp;=I_{t-1}+\\alpha\\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N}-\\beta I_{t-1}-\\gamma I_{t-1} \\\\\nR_{t}&amp;=R_{t-1}+\\beta I_{t-1} \\\\\nD_{t}&amp;=D_{t-1}+\\gamma I_{t-1} \\\\\n\\end{cases} \\qquad \\text{for} \\,\\, t=1,2,\\dots$$\n\n\n\n0.1 first attempt\n\nIn my first try I've used for the estimation of the parameters $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ a very simple strategy by searching the least squares parameters that minimize the quadratic cost of the 1-step prediction along all the observation horizon. The complete dissertation of this problem is here (note: in this thread I will use the same notations that I've used in the cited thread).\nThe estimation problem is very easy to resolve, but leads to a result with very poor performances.\n\n\n\n0.2 second attempt\n\nAs Sextus Empiricus suggests to me, using the 1-step prediction, i.e.\n$$\\tag{13}\\hat{y}_t(\\theta)=\\varphi_t \\theta + y_{t-1} \\qquad \\text{for} \\,\\, t=0, 1, 2,\\dots$$\nis not a good idea because, once one has found the parameters, during the simulation phase the model haves to feedback the proper previous predictions. This means, in principle, that the right way to tune the parameters $\\theta$ is to minimize some suitable cost function of the prediction errors generated by a \"batch\" predictor of the form\n$$\\tag{14}\\hat{y}_t(\\theta)=\\hat\\varphi(\\hat{y}_{t-1}) \\theta + \\hat{y}_{t-1} \\qquad \\text{for} \\,\\, t=0, 1, 2,\\dots$$\nwhere\n$$\\tag{15}\\hat\\varphi(\\hat{y}_{t-1}) \\triangleq \\begin{bmatrix}\n    -\\frac{\\hat{S}_{t-1}\\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\\\ \n    \\phantom{-}\\frac{\\hat{S}_{t-1}\\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; -\\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; -\\hat{I}_{t-1}  \\\\  \n    0 &amp; \\phantom{-}\\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; 0\\\\  \n    0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\phantom{-}\\hat{I}_{t-1}\n\\end{bmatrix} \\qquad \\text{for} \\,\\, t=1,2,\\dots$$\nand $\\hat{S}_{t-1}, \\hat{I}_{t-1}$ are predictions (and not observed values) generated by the model. As a consequence, the new estimation problem \n$$\\tag{16}\\theta_\\text{LS}\\triangleq \\arg\\min_{\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R^3}} V_T (\\theta)$$\nwith the same quadratic cost $V_T(\\theta)\\triangleq \\frac{1}{2}\\sum _{t=0}^T \\|y_t-\\hat{y}_t(\\theta) \\|^2$ is not easy anymore because now the considered model $(14)$ is not linear in his parameter $\\theta$.\n\nTo resolve $(16)$, under the suggestion Sextus Empiricus, I've chosen a numerical approach. More precisely, I've used a simple gradient descent equipped with Armijo's adaptive learning rate / step update, with a simple finite-difference approximation of the gradient. The optimization works pretty well, but from the starting guess $\\theta_{\\text{LS},0}=0$ converges to a parameter $\\theta_{\\text{LS},\\infty}$ with a non-zero cost that doesn't satisfies me in the final simulation phase.\n\nI've tried several different optimizations by using randomly different initializations $\\theta_{\\text{LS},0}$ (like a MultiStart global optimization policy) with even worse results. \n\n\n\n0.3 third attempt\n\nI'm quite sure that the optimizer works well, so I believe that to improve the performance of the final simulator it is necessary to increase the expressivity of the model $(12)$.\nTo make a step ahead towards an acceptable solution, under the observations of Sextus Empiricus, now I want make an attempt where I increase the difficult of the estimation problem by relaxing the time-invariance hypothesis of the parameters. Thus, now I consider this more complicated model \n$$\\tag{17}\\begin{cases}\nS_{t}&amp;=S_{t-1}-\\alpha_t\\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N} \\\\ \nI_{t}&amp;=I_{t-1}+\\alpha_t\\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N}-\\beta_t I_{t-1}-\\gamma_t I_{t-1} \\\\\nR_{t}&amp;=R_{t-1}+\\beta_t I_{t-1} \\\\\nD_{t}&amp;=D_{t-1}+\\gamma_t I_{t-1} \\\\\n\\end{cases} \\qquad \\text{for} \\,\\, t=1,2,\\dots$$\nThe actual \"dynamic\" estimation problem can be solved by using a Kalman filter.\n\nnote: as mentioned by Sextus Empiricus, another possible approach to the problem is to tune the parameters by using the explicit solution of the SIRD model. I don't want follow this way because, as a student in control system engineering, I'm interested in learn how to identify generic dynamical systems in their implicit state-space representations. The SIRD problem is a \"toy example\" that I'm trying to resolve better as possible in my quarantine free-time. \n\n1 Kalman Filtering\n\n1.1 dynamic system model\n\nConsider the following linear, time-variant and autonomous state-space model for a dynamic system \n$$\\tag{18}\\begin{cases} x_{t+1} &amp;= A_t x_t+w_t \\\\ y_t &amp;= C_t x_t+v_t \\end{cases}\\qquad \\text{for} \\,\\, t=0,1,2,\\dots$$\nwhere $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the state vector, $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ is the output vector of the system and the parameters $A\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ and $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times n}$ are matrices. The signals $w\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $v\\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ are white noises characterized respectively by null mean values and covariances $Q\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$  and $R\\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times p}$, i.e.\n$$\\begin{align} w_t &amp;= \\text{wn}(0,Q_t) \\\\ v_t &amp;= \\text{wn}(0,R_t) \\end{align}\\qquad \\text{for} \\,\\, t=0,1,2,\\dots \\tag{19}$$\n\n\n\n1.2 Kalman filter definition \n\nThe Kalman filter is another dynamic system that estimates dynamically the state of the system $(18)$ by watching the model $(18)$ and a dataset $D\\triangleq\\{y_0, y_1, y_2, \\dots\\}$ of observed outputs. The estimation process is a recursion starting from the initial state $x_0$, that is unknown and modelled as a random variable with mean value $\\hat{x_0}\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and covariance $P_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$, i.e.\n$$\\tag{20} x_0 \\sim (\\hat{x}_0, P_0)$$\nAt every time instant $t=1,2,3,\\dots$ the recursion is splitted in two different steps:\n\n\ncorrection: the filter computes the estimate $\\hat{x}_{t|t}$ of the state $x_t$ by considering all the observed past values $y_0,y_1, \\dots, y_{t-1}$, summarized in a predicted estimate $\\hat{x}_{t|t-1}$, and the actual observation $y_t$. Such estimate $\\hat{x}_{t|t}$ is characterized by the covariance $P_{t|t}$; \nprediction: the filter computes the estimate $\\hat{x}_{t+1|t}$ of the state $x_{t+1}$ by considering the first equation of the model $(18)$. Such estimate $\\hat{x}_{t+1|t}$ is characterized by the covariance $P_{t+1|t}$. \n\n\nthe Kalman filter algorithm is the following\n$$\\boxed{\\begin{align} \n\\text{FOR}\\quad &amp;t=1,2,3,\\dots :\\\\\n&amp;e_t \\triangleq y_t - C_t \\hat{x}_{t|t-1} \\\\\n&amp;S_t \\triangleq  C_t P_{t|t-1}C_t'+R_t \\\\\n&amp;L_t \\triangleq  P_{t|t-1}C_t' S_t ^{-1} \\\\\n&amp;\\text{1) correction}\\\\\n&amp;\\hat{x}_{t|t} \\triangleq \\hat{x}_{t|t-1}+L_t e_t \\\\\n&amp;P_{t|t} \\triangleq (I-L_t C_t)P_{t|t-1}(I-L_t C_t)'+L_t R_t L_t'\\\\\n&amp;\\text{2) prediction}\\\\\n&amp;\\hat{x}_{t+1|t} \\triangleq A_t \\hat{x}_{t|t}\\\\\n&amp;P_{t+1|t} \\triangleq A_t P_{t|t}A_t'+ Q_t\n\\end{align}}\\tag{21}$$\nnote: if $x_0$, $w_t$, $v_\\tau$, are gaussians and incorrelated for all the possible choices of $t, \\tau$ then at every time istant $t$ the estimate $\\hat{x}_{t|t}$ is by definition the MMSE estimate of the state $x_t$, so the Kalman Filter finds the optimal estimation of the state $x_t$.\n\nnote: the signal $e_t$ is called innovation and it is the prediction error of the output of the system $(18)$ (since the predicted output generated by the Kalman filter is $\\hat{y}_{t|t-1}=C_t \\hat{x}_{t|t-1}$). Here the matrix $S_t$ is the covariance of the innovation (and not the number of susceptibles at time $t$, I hope that it is clear from the context when I'm talking about the innovation covariance or the number of susceptibles). The matrix $L_t$ is called correction gain since it is used to define the corrected estimate $\\hat{x}_{t|t}$. The matrix $I$ is an identity matrix $n \\times n$.\n\nnote: the initialization is $\\hat{x}_{1|0}\\triangleq \\hat{x}_0$, $P_{1|0} \\triangleq P_0$.\n\n\n\n1.3 application to the SIRD estimation problem: static estimation\n\nBefore to jump in to the more general problem that involves the model $(17)$, I want to use the Kalman filter to make a more simpler \"static\" estimation of the parameters.\nIn order to use the Kalman filter, the idea is to define the following non-linear, time-variant, static system\n$$\\begin{cases}x_{t+1} &amp;=x_t+w_t \\\\\ny_t &amp;=h_t(x_t)+v_t\\end{cases}\\qquad \\text{for} \\,\\, t=0,1,2,\\dots \\tag{22}$$\nwhere \n$$x_t \\triangleq \\begin{bmatrix}\n    \\alpha_t  \\\\ \n    \\beta_t  \\\\  \n    \\gamma_t \\\\  \n\\end{bmatrix} \\qquad \ny_t \\triangleq \\begin{bmatrix}\n    S_t  \\\\ \n    I_t  \\\\  \n    R_t \\\\  \n    D_t \n\\end{bmatrix} \\qquad \nh_t(x_t) \\triangleq \\begin{bmatrix}\n    {S}_{t-1}-\\frac{{S}_{t-1}{I}_{t-1}}{N}\\alpha_t \\\\ \n    {I}_{t-1}-{I}_{t-1}\\beta_t-{I}_t\\gamma_t+\\frac{{S}_{t-1}{I}_{t-1}}{N}\\alpha_t  \\\\  \n    {R}_{t-1}+{I}_{t-1}\\beta_t \\\\  \n    {D}_{t-1}+{I}_{t-1}\\gamma_t \n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\text{for} \\,\\, t=0,1,2,\\dots \\tag{23}\n$$\nthe system $(22)$ is not linear, so the idea to deal with this problem is to consider a simple linearization around the estimate $\\hat{x}_{t|t-1}$of the output equation (like in an extended Kalman filter). \n$$y_t \\approx h_t(\\hat{x}_{t|t-1})+\\frac{\\partial h_t}{\\partial x_t}\\Bigg|_{x_t=\\hat{x}_{t|t-1}}(x_t-\\hat{x}_{t|t-1})+v_t \\tag{24}$$\nby defining the new coordinates\n$$\\tilde{y}_t \\triangleq y_t-h_t(\\hat{x}_{t|t-1}) \\qquad \\tilde{x}_t \\triangleq x_t -\\hat{x}_{t|t-1} \\tag{25}$$\nand the time-variant matrix\n$$C_t \\triangleq \\frac{\\partial h_t}{\\partial x_t}\\Bigg|_{x_t=\\hat{x}_{t|t-1}}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n    -\\frac{\\hat{S}_{t-1}\\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\\\ \n    \\phantom{-}\\frac{\\hat{S}_{t-1}\\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; -\\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; -\\hat{I}_{t-1}  \\\\  \n    0 &amp; \\phantom{-}\\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; 0\\\\  \n    0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\phantom{-}\\hat{I}_{t-1}\n\\end{bmatrix} \\tag{26}$$\nthe system $(22)$ is approximated by the linear system\n$$\\begin{cases}\\tilde{x}_{t+1} &amp;=\\tilde{x}_t+w_t \\\\\n\\tilde{y}_t &amp;=C_t \\tilde{x}_t+v_t\\end{cases}\\qquad \\text{for} \\,\\, t=0,1,2,\\dots \\tag{27}$$\nat this point it is possible to apply the Kalman filter $(21)$ to get an estimation for the parameters $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$.\n\n\n\n1.4 application to the SIRD estimation problem: dynamic estimation\n\nIn order to take into account the time dependency of the parameters it is sufficient to modify the first equation of the system $(22)$ in a suitable way that reflects approximately the real dynamic of the parameters\n$$\\begin{cases}x_{t+1} &amp;=f_t(x_t)+w_t \\\\\ny_t &amp;=h_t(x_t)+v_t\\end{cases}\\qquad \\text{for} \\,\\, t=0,1,2,\\dots \\tag{28}$$\nin other words, the dynamic of the parameters $\\alpha_t, \\beta_t,\\gamma_t$ is described by the motion model $f_t(x_t)$. To get an estimate of theese parameters it is possible to use an extended Kalman filter like in the previous section 1.3. \n\n\n\n2 My Questions\n\nBefore to writing down some code to get experimental responses, I'd like to have some suggestions about the previous dissertation. I have also two questions.\n\n\nI'm not sure that $C_t$ is well defined. Let's assume that his definition $(26)$ is correct. Since the prediction model is $(14)$, that is a dynamic model, the quantities $\\hat{S}_{t-1}$ and $\\hat{I}_{t-1}$ are functions of all the previous predictions $\\hat{y}_0 (\\theta=\\hat{x}_{t|t-1}),\\hat{y}_1 (\\theta=\\hat{x}_{t|t-1}), \\dots, \\hat{y}_{t-2} (\\theta=\\hat{x}_{t|t-1})$. This means that at every time step the computational burden to get $C_t$ increase because it requires the simulation with the actual parameter $\\theta=\\hat{x}_{t|t-1}$ of the system $(12)$ up to time $t-2$ (that is increasing). It is possible to define a more efficient recursive formula to define $C_t$?\nHow can we define a reasonable motion model $f_t(x_t)$ that can take into account the observations made by Sextus Empiricus in the reply in my first thread?\n\n",
    "answer_id": "459081",
    "answer": "Nice write-up. I think eq#23 is not quite correct though. The observation $y_t$ should be a function of the state $x_t$ and noise $v_t$, like you said in eq#22 $y_t = h(x_t) + v_t$.\n\nThe issue with eq#23 is that $y_t$ depends on $y_{t-1}$. This would break the Markov assumption that $x_t$ is a sufficient state, which is foundational to the Kalman filter formulation.\n\nI think the correct approach is to use\n$$\nx_t := \\begin{bmatrix} S_t \\\\ I_t \\\\ R_t \\\\ D_t \\\\ \\alpha_t \\\\ \\beta_t \\\\ \\gamma_t \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThis would be considered \"augmenting the state\" (SIRD) with the parameters ($\\alpha$,$\\beta$,$\\gamma$) to do a \"joint-state-parameter\" estimation.\n\nYour dynamic would be\n$$\nx_{t+1} =\\begin{bmatrix}\n    {S}_{t}-\\frac{{S}_{t}{I}_{t}}{N}\\alpha_t \\\\ \n    {I}_{t}-{I}_{t}\\beta_t-{I}_t\\gamma_t+\\frac{{S}_{t}{I}_{t}}{N}\\alpha_t  \\\\  \n    {R}_{t}+{I}_{t}\\beta_t \\\\  \n    {D}_{t}+{I}_{t}\\gamma_t \\\\ f_\\alpha(x_t)\\\\f_\\beta(x_t) \\\\ f_\\gamma(x_t)\n\\end{bmatrix} + w_t\n$$\n\nYou can treat the SIRD part of the dynamic as deterministic if you so desire by setting its entries of the covariance $Q_t$of $w_t$ to $0$, though that places all the uncertainty on the initial condition and parameters, which I don't think accurately reflects reality - the SIRD model isn't perfect even with best-fit parameters.\n\nYour observation model would be the actual data, which we'd consider to be measurements of the SIRD part of the state, corrupted by noise (which you can remove by making its covariance $R_t \\approx 0$ if you think the SIRD records are perfect).\n$$\ny_t = \\begin{bmatrix} S_t \\\\ I_t \\\\ R_t \\\\ D_t \\end{bmatrix} + v_t\n$$\n\nAs for what you should design for $f_\\alpha(x_t)$ and the other parameter dynamics, I think a random walk is fine (i.e. $f_\\alpha(x_t) = \\alpha_t$ so all the movement is due to the $\\alpha$-component of $w_t$). But really I think designing a more sophisticated structure for that is a matter of studying epidemiology more. By creating a structured dynamic for the parameters, you are essentially making a more detailed model than what SIRD alone captures. Such an advanced design should probably be rooted in hard science, else it just becomes excess model capacity ripe for overfitting / poor generalization.\n\nIn other words, if you want a model for how the parameters would move, you should come up with an explanation / mechanism for why they would move. What do these parameters mean - what dynamical factors would influence them?\n\nBy the way, the selection of the noise covariances is pretty critical to the usefulness of the Kalman filter. If you are using them as tuning knobs rather than estimating them from data, you might as well just go back to your second approach (nonlinear regression of a multi-step predictor) and just use Gauss-Newton's method instead of gradient descent for optimization. The extended Kalman filter is essentially a covariance-weighted recursive application of Gauss-Newton least-squares.\n",

Consider for a moment that if there are $x$ reported cases of the flu then there can be more cases we have not seen, but not fewer.

    "answer": "Too early to fit models with $R_0$ (with only data about the number of infected people).\n\nThe larger problem is that the development is still in the exponential phase and we can not model the decrease of the exponential growth rate.

That number does not provide a good measure of $R_0$, but it is auxiliary information that is being used. For instance direct estimates of $\\gamma$ the parameter relating to how long people remain infectious (by observing how the virus has spread, rather than just using the quantitative numbers).\n\n\n\nregarding your problem/question\n\nBinomial distribution\n\nOne might model the reported cases as a binomial distributed variable. The observed/reported cases will be some fraction $p$ of the underlying real cases (in more advanced models this fraction could be variable depending on time and the number of cases). But the current data do not allow to study this (potentially one can fill in the gaps based on studies on a wider set of epidemical data). \n\nGiven such situation (a binomial distributed fraction) one would expect that the variance is related to the mean by a factor between 0 and 1 (binomial distribution has $\\mu = np$ and $var = npq$). However when we plot an exponential curve to the data then we currently get RSS being a factor 4 larger than the sum of means. Thus there is posibly overdispersion instead of underdispersion (although it is not yet a good accurate measure*).\n\n*With so little data we can not be sure.

I was wondering if there was any commonly used statistical model to predict with some accuracy the mortality rate of an ongoing epidemic. If there is, I'm guessing some of the variables would be the time between the onsetting of symptoms and death/healing for resolved cases.\n",
    "answer_id": "446923",
    "answer": "A natural (and perhaps naive) way to model mortality would be a binomial model, i.e.,\n\n$$\nx \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)\n$$\n\nHere $x$ is the number of deaths, $n$ is the total number of people infected, and $p$ is the mortality rate, or the probability of dying given that you have the disease. \nWhen we say something is distributed according to a binomial distribution, we mean that the observed counts $x$ are the result of $n$ independent trials, each with probability of \"success\" (in this case, death) $p$. These are usually termed \"Bernoulli trials\".\n\nWe can now examine the likelihood of $p$ given $x$ and $n$ -- i.e., how likely it would be to see the data we have observed, given different values of $p$. Imagine we had 100 cases, 50 of which resulted in deaths:\n\nn &lt;- 100\nx &lt;- 50\ns &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)\nplot(\n  s, dbinom(x, size = n, prob = s), type=\"l\",\n  xlab = \"Mortality rate (p)\", ylab = \"Binomial likelihood\"\n)\n\n\n\n\nThis shows that a point estimate (the maximum likelihood estimate) would be 0.5, which of course makes sense. Something important to consider here is the amount of data we have observed. Since we have a good amount of observations, the likelihood is fairly narrow. This means that there is a relatively small range of values for $p$ for which the data we observed would be likely to occur.\n\nNow, imagine if we had only 10 cases, 5 of which resulted in deaths:\n\nx &lt;- 5\nn &lt;- 10\ns &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)\nplot(\n  s, dbinom(x, size = n, prob = s), type=\"l\",\n  xlab = \"Mortality rate (p)\", ylab = \"Binomial likelihood\"\n)\n\n\n\n\nWhen we don't have much information, the likelihood is quite broad, indicating that the data would be fairly likely for a wide range of values for $p$.\n\nIt can be helpful in cases like this to incorporate a prior, or how likely we think different parameter values are, based on our existing knowledge. For example, imagine that we knew that the distribution of mortality rates across all known human diseases looked something like this:\n\ns &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)\nplot(\n  s, dbeta(s, 32, 64), type=\"l\",\n  xlab = \"Mortality rate (p)\", ylab = \"Proportion of diseases\"\n)\n\n\n\n\nThis is a Beta prior with $\\alpha=32$ and $\\beta=64$, i.e.,\n$ p \\sim \\text{Beta}(32, 64)$.\nWe might want to use this prior information to guide our inferences about the mortality rate of a new disease for which we have very little information. We can combine this prior information with the likelihoods we've already plotted. If you want details about how this is done, one great starting point is this blog by David Robinson. Basically, the posterior distribution over our parameters is a Beta distribution. For parameters we take the $\\alpha$ of our prior and add $x$, and take the $\\beta$ of our prior and add $n-x$.\n\ns &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)\nn &lt;- 100\nx &lt;- 50\nplot(\n  s, dbeta(s, shape1 = 32 + x, shape2 = 64 + n - x), \n  type=\"l\", xlab = \"Mortality rate (p)\", ylab = \"Posterior density\"\n)\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this prior information \"pulls\" our estimates downwards towards the distribution of existing mortality rates. However, if we had strong enough evidence (for example, thousands of infections and deaths) we could still produce an estimate outside of where the prior distribution is concentrated. When we have a small amount of data, a prior can be particularly helpful to avoid results that are purely the result of sampling noise - for example, imagine the first 10 people with a disease happen to die, and the next 90 survive. The estimate after 10 people would be 100%, which is extremely unlikely, given what we've seen about human disease in the past.\n\ns &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)\nn &lt;- 10\nx &lt;- 5\nplot(\n  s, dbeta(s, shape1 = 32 + x, shape2 = 64 + n - x),\n  type=\"l\", xlab = \"Mortality rate (p)\", ylab = \"Posterior density\"\n)\n\n\n\n\nWhen we have very little data, this prior information really shrinks our estimates towards what we believe is a reasonable estimate of mortality, given what we've observed in the past about other diseases.\n\nYou can continually update this posterior distribution as new data comes in  by adding deaths to the $\\alpha$ parameter and survivals to the $\\beta$ parameter of the Beta distribution.\n\nThis is all just general; I have no real expertise in disease modelling. None of the parameters values I've chosen have any basis in reality.\n",

For example, for these values:\n\nf = [0,110,200,300,0]\ng = [0, 13, 6, 9, 0]\nh = [1, 3, 6, 9, 1]\n\n\nhow would you wish sim(d,f) and sim(e,g) to compare? What about sim(h,b) - would a Minkowski distance with p != 1 be any good for you? How about negative p?\n\nHowever, you can try to construct a combined parametrised metric that satisfies your desired properties. You've already identified cosine similarity, manhattan similarity and normalisation to be useful. I'll give you an example in python, because it is as good as any language (or pseudolanguage) and it determines functions that otherwise might have more than one possible definition.\n\nThe basic principle is that one could use the metrics that have the desired properties, parametrise them, and finally weight them to achieve the desired balance. They need to be in the same domain, and because of cosine similarity I will bring all metrics in the [0,1] domain.\n\nI'm not employing normalisation, because I don't see how it could add value to discern the given values. This might change, depending on other relationships you might wish to provide.\n\nSo an initial take could be this:\n\nfrom math import atan, pi\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import cosine, cityblock\n\na = [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]\nb = [0, 3, 6, 9, 0]\nc = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nd = [0, 100, 200, 300, 0]\ne = [0, 110, 210, 310, 0]\n\ncoef1 = 100\n\ndef man_derived(a, b):\n    return (2 / pi) * atan(cityblock(a, b))\n\ndef bespoke_sim(a, b, p1):\n    return (1 - cosine(a, b)) * (1 - man_derived(a, b))**p1\n\nprint(\"sim(d,e)=%.5f\"%bespoke_sim(d,e,coef1))\nprint(\"sim(a,b)=%.5f\"%bespoke_sim(a,b,coef1))\nprint(\"sim(a,c)=%.5f\"%bespoke_sim(a,c,coef1))\nprint(\"sim(a,d)=%.5f\"%bespoke_sim(a,d,coef1))\nprint(\"sim(a,e)=%.5f\"%bespoke_sim(a,e,coef1))\n\n\nThis results in:\n\nsim(d,e)=0.88270\nsim(a,b)=0.99565\nsim(a,c)=0.71714\nsim(a,d)=0.10168\nsim(a,e)=0.09702\n\n\nThis gives you a desired order of the other elements, except for sim(d,e), but as I already indicated, I am not sure what logic should lead this to be larger then sim(a,e).\n\nIn general I hope you can see the thinking: Metrics are combined by multiplication, because this keeps them in the [0,1] domain. Parameters (in the example this is p2)are used to weight individual metrics by rising them to a higher multiplicative power.\n\nAlso, you didn't want to limit your domain, but obviously one event has different implications when one of few, and when one of many. Then what is many - 100, 1 million, more? In my formula this comes into play with the atan function.\n",

    "title": "Coronavirus growth rate and its possibly spurious resemblance to vapor pressure model",
    "question": "I collected the latest data on the coronavirus from Johns Hopkins University as shown and fitted different curves to this data to model the relationship between the number of confirmed patients $P$ who are/were infected as function of time $T$ taking 20-Jan-20 as day 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs opposed to applying the standard SIR and SEIR I tried out simple curve fitting to see the general trend. The curve fitting software I used has well known models form different branches of science as well as we could build our own custom models which I did as shown in the image below. The score against the name of a model gives how well a model fits this data. The higher the score, the better the fit and the maximum possible score is 1000. Although we have data only for 18 days (as of 7-Feb 2 AM GMT) one model always kept appearing at top as the best fit and this was the vapor pressure model. After checking for various boundary conditions, I rejected many of models but I could not find any immediately reason to reject the vapor pressure model. Similarly when I modeled the number of reported deaths against time, the vapor pressure model once again gave the best fit which for which I could not find any obvious reasons to reject.\n\n\n\nSo I did some research on the vapor pressure model.\n\nBasic concept of vapor pressure Because the molecules of a liquid $L$ are in constant motion and possess kinetic energies, at any moment some fraction of them has enough energy to escape from the surface of the liquid to enter the gas phase. This process, called evaporation, generates a vapor pressure $P_L$ above the liquid. Molecules in the gas phase can collide with the liquid surface and reenter the liquid via condensation. Eventually, a steady state is reached in which the number of molecules evaporating and condensing per unit time is the same, and the system is in a state of dynamic equilibrium. Under these conditions, a liquid exhibits a characteristic equilibrium vapor pressure that depends only on the temperature $T_L$. Volatile liquids are liquids with high vapor pressures, which tend to evaporate readily from an open container; nonvolatile liquids have low vapor pressures. When the vapor pressure equals the external pressure, bubbles of vapor form within the liquid, and it boils. We can express the nonlinear relationship between vapor pressure and temperature as an almost linear relationship using the Antoine equation. \n\n$$\nP_L = exp\\Big(a + \\frac{b}{T_L} + c\\log T_L\\Big)\n$$\n\nNext I did some research what is known about how the coronavirus spreads and if it is related to liquids. Here is what I found. \n\n\n  How coronavirus spreads: When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they shed droplets of saliva, mucus, or other bodily fluids. If any of those droplets fall on you—or if you touch them and then, say, touch your face—you can become infected as well. Hospital for communicable diseases define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person for 10 minutes or longer. Time and distance matters.\n\n\nThe coronavirus spreads when it escapes from an infected person through microscopic droplets of liquid carrying the virus through air. I wonder this has anything to do with why the vapor pressure model keeps coming on the top as the best fit even though there is no apparent pressure or temperature as in the vapor pressure equation and I cannot see how they could be elated. May be all this just a mere coincidence. \n\n\n  As a bad scientist but a concerned human, I thought I must report this\n  observation in case there is anything worth in it.\n\n\nQuestion: Given this limited data what can we infer about the corona virus growth rate and how can we reject the vapor pressure model as a mere spurious correlation.\n\nNote 1: I am well aware of spurious correlation. But with only 3 weeks of data, we many not be able to detect a different trend this early. Hence I am reporting the best fit regardless.\n",

You observe an exponential growth, a common phenomena in many natural and artificial processes. The curve fits well, but  I'd bet that other similar curves would also fit well.\n\nNotice that the the Antoine equation mentioned by you, is a very flexible one, since it can account for constant ($\\alpha$), exponential ($b/T_L$), and linear ($c\\log T_L$) growth curves. This makes it easy to fit to many datasets.\n\nMoreover, with this kind of data, it may be harder to model it at early stages. Notice that you could fit a linear growth model to the earliest period. Later, quadratic may fit just fine. Later, exponential would fit better, where the exact rate may be hard to catch, since by definition \"the more it grows, then the more it grows\", and it may easy speed up quite rapidly.

    "answer_id": "453878",
    "answer": "Death rate\n\nUsing death rate may work when people that die have most likely acquired the virus locally. \n\nHowever, for the moment, many people die because they acquired the virus during a visit to another area, or because they got it from another person that acquired the virus abroad. \n\nThus this death-rate based number is not very accurate unless the virus has fully spread out (in which case it will be more likely to get infected from a local source). \n\nFor the cases of Wuhan, Italy and other epi-centers, which have more spread due to local infections rather than foreign infections, death rate might be a good probe (although you still have to deal with the delay).\n\nIn addition, while death rate might be more thrustworthy than total cases of infection (just think about the Germans, with lots of supplies, are testing with a lot of thousands people, while neighboring countries, with limited supplies, are trying to limit the use of testing as much as possible), bit it is still a biased number. It is not easy to determine/pinpoint the cause of death. Often multitude of diseases are present. If a person with cancer or aids gets a pneumonia from nCoV-19, then what is the cause? The sampling of 'cause of death' is not very clear and becomes part of the analysis.\n\nStatistics are only usefull for a comparison when they have a similar underlying basis. \n\nTravel data\n\nThe virus is mostly spreading out irregularly over a network. It spreads out differently at different scales, within the household, neighborhood, workplaces/schools, villages, agglomerations, countries, continents.  You can sort of see the virus spread around with sudden jumps from large node/community to large node/community. \n\nYou can use occurrence of the virus in those nodes/communities as the variable (so you do not count individuals, since we do not know the presence in all individuals, but instead count the much better known presence of the virus in communities), and then use a model for the dynamics of the virus spreading between this different nodes in the network.\n\nFor instance. E.g. in region A you encounter x cases of disease among people that came from region B and y cases of disease among people that came from region C, while the travel to those regions is $r$ and $q$, then an estimate of the relative presence of the virus in regions B:C can be approximated by (x/r):(y/q).\n\nI remember there was an early article on the spread of COVID-19 (I believe it was by Chinese scholars) that tried to estimate $R_0$ and included information about the frequency of travel between different regions.\n\n\n\nRandom tests\n\nYou can perform test on a sample from the population that does not show any symptoms and use the prevalence of the virus among this sample to make an estimate about the prevalence in the entire population.\n\nIf the prevalence is very small then this requires a very large sample which might be difficult. In that case one may perform the test among a sample where the suspicion of the prevalence is higher and gain some information about how many people have the virus in that group. Such a measure can be used to calibrate the estimates based on incomplete information (ie. along with other information, such as the rate at which people with the virus have the particular mild or severe symptoms, you get an idea about how much the current estimates are underestimating the true number of cases).\n",

    "title": "Trying to Estimate Disease Prevalence from Fragmentary Test Results",
    "question": "In response to the spread of COVID-19 disease, all Californians were ordered on 19 March 2020 to stay at home, except for such necessary errands as trips to grocery stores, pharmacies, etc. On 21 March the San Francisco Chronicle reported that about $11\\,500$ tests for the virus have been completed so far with $1206$ positive results among them. \n\nCan anything useful be said about the prevalence of the virus in California based on these results? If (a) the 11500 tests were from randomly chosen Californians and (b) the tests were of \"gold standard\" quality, then prevalence would be close to $1206/11500 =  0.1049 \\approx 10.5\\%.$\n\nHowever, according to the Chronicle article, guidelines have centered on testing people showing symptoms of COVID-19 disease, care workers who have had contact with COVID-19 patients, and people who have symptoms of pneumonia, but test negative for pneumonia. Moreover, tests are \"coming from a growing list of private companies, private labs, and public and private universities,\" so there is no way to know proportions of false positives and false negatives for any one test, let alone the overall rates for whatever mix of tests accounts for the 11,500 reported results.\n\nIn my answer below, I will extend my answer to this question to give prevalence values resulting from various assumptions about the sensitivity and specificity of the tests involved. I use the notation of that page. This analysis may help to answer the question for whatever population produced the specimens tested.\n\nAdditional answers are welcome, perhaps showing alternative methods or based on\nadditional information that may become available as the pandemic\ncontinues\n",

    "answer": "Notation. Let $\\pi = P(\\text{Disease})$ be the prevalence of the disease in the population and $\\tau = P(\\text{Pos Test})$ be the proportion testing positive. For the test, let\n$\\eta = P(\\text{Pos}|\\text{Disease})$ be the sensitivity and\n$\\theta = P(\\text{Neg}|\\text{No Disease})$ be its specificity. Also, given test results, let \n$\\gamma =  P(\\text{Disease}| \\text{Pos})$ and \n$\\delta =  P(\\text{No Disease}| \\text{Neg})$ be, respectively, the predictive powers of a positive or negative test.\n\nIf a test is of gold standard quality with $\\eta = \\theta = 1,$ then $\\pi = \\tau.$ Tests that accurately sequence the genome of the virus may be gold standard tests. Often the first tests for a virus may have considerably lower values of $\\eta$ and $\\theta.$ It is difficult to find accounts of values of $\\eta$ and $\\theta$ for any of the tests in current use for COVID-19. (According to one unauthorized report, a test used in China had $\\theta \\approx 0.7.)$\n\nTraditional estimate. First, we look at results for tests with $\\eta = \\theta = 0.95.$ Then for data with $n= 11\\,500; a = 1206,$ we have $\\hat \\tau = t = 0.1049.$ The associated 95% Wald confidence interval for $\\tau$ is $(0.0993, 0.1105)$\nfrom which one can derive the confidence interval\n$(0.0547, 0.0672)$ for $\\pi.$ Also, $\\pi = 0.061$ implies that the predictive power of a positive test is $\\gamma = 0.5523.$ Only about half of the subjects testing positive are actually infected.\nSome computations in R follow:\n\nETA = THETA = .95\nn = 11500;  a = 1206;  p0m = -1:1; t = a/n\nwald.TAU = t +p0m*1.96*sqrt(t*(1-t)/n);  wald.TAU\n[1] 0.09926973 0.10486957 0.11046940\nci.PI = (wald.T + THETA - 1)/(ETA + THETA - 1);  ci.PI\n[1] 0.05474415 0.06096618 0.06718822\nPI = (t + THETA -1)/(ETA + THETA -1); PI\n[1] 0.06096618\nGAMMA = PI*ETA/(PI*ETA + (1-PI)*(1-THETA)); GAMMA\n[1] 0.5522849\n\n\nWhen the traditional estimate is problematic. For a poorer test with $\\eta = \\theta = 0.90,$ this method gives a CI for $\\pi$ \nas $(-0.0009, 0.0131),$ which has a (nonsensical) negative left endpoint. (We would expect about 1150 false positive tests even with no infected subjects. This is getting close to the the observed number 1206 of positive tests.) In such circumstances, one wonders whether to trust the point estimates $\\hat \\pi = 0.0061$ and $\\hat \\gamma = 0.0522.$\n\nETA = THETA = .9\nn = 11500;  a = 1206;  p0m = -1:1; t = a/n\nwald.TAU = t +p0m*1.96*sqrt(t*(1-t)/n);  wald.TAU\n[1] 0.09926973 0.10486957 0.11046940 \nci.PI = (wald.T + THETA - 1)/(ETA + THETA - 1);  ci.PI\n[1] -0.0009128343  0.0060869565  0.0130867473\nPI = (t + THETA -1)/(ETA + THETA -1); PI\n[1] 0.006086957\nGAMMA = PI*ETA/(PI*ETA + (1-PI)*(1-THETA)); GAMMA\n[1] 0.05223881\n\n\nA Gibbs sampler. One useful alternative approach is to assume a beta prior distribution on prevalence $\\pi \\sim \\mathsf{Beta(\\alpha, \\beta)}.$ Even if noninformative with $\\alpha = \\beta = 0.5,$ such a prior distribution excludes value of $\\pi$ outside $(0,1).$\nThen we use a Gibbs sampler to find the posterior distribution of $\\pi,$ given our data $n = 11\\,500, a = 1206.$ Its steps, within each iteration, are as follows:\n\n\nWe begin with an arbitrary value of $\\pi_1 \\in (0,1)$ and use it to estimate 'latent' counts of subjects with the disease based on predictive values $\\gamma$ and $\\delta.$ We sample counts $X \\sim \\mathsf{Binom}(a, \\gamma)$ and $Y \\sim \\mathsf{Binom}(n-A, 1 - \\delta).$\nThen with the estimated $S = X+Y$ infected subjects, we update the beta prior at this step as $\\pi|S \\sim \\mathsf{BETA}(\\alpha + S, \\beta + n - S).$ Finally, we sample $\\pi_2$ from this updated distribution. Even with arbitrary $\\pi_1,$ this new value $\\pi_2$ is likely to be closer to the truth.\n\n\nSimulated posterior distribution. Iterating through many such steps we get successive values $\\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3, \\dots ,$\nin a convergent Markov chain, for which the limiting distribution is the desired posterior distribution of the prevalence. To make sure that the chain has reached steady state, we\nuse only the last half of the many values $\\pi_i$ generated in this way. \n\nCutting 2.5% of the probability from each tail of the simulated posterior distribution, we can obtain a 95% Bayesian probability estimate for prevalence $\\pi.$\n\nset.seed(1020)\nm = 10^5                             # iterations\nPI = GAMMA = Gamma = numeric(m)      # vectors for results\nPI[1] = .5                           # initial value\nalpha = .5; beta = .5                # parameters of beta prior\nETA = .9; THETA = .9                 # sensitivity; specificity\nn = 11500; A = 1206; B = n - A       # data\nfor (i in 2:m)\n  {\n  num.x = PI[i-1]*ETA; den.x = num.x + (1-PI[i-1])*(1 - THETA)\n  GAMMA[i] = num.x/den.x\n  X = rbinom(1, A, num.x/den.x)  # use est of gamma as probability\n  num.y = PI[i-1]*(1 - ETA); den.y = num.y + (1-PI[i-1])*THETA\n  Y = rbinom(1, B, num.y/den.y)  # use 1 - est of delta as probability\n  PI[i] = rbeta(1, X + Y + alpha, n - X - Y + beta)\n}\naft.brn = seq(floor(m/2),m)\nquantile(PI[aft.brn], c(.025, .975))\n        2.5%        97.5% \n3.329477e-05 1.225794e-02 \nquantile(PI[aft.brn], .95)\n       95% \n0.01101075 \nmean(PI[aft.brn])\n[1] 0.0049096\n\nquantile(GAMMA[aft.brn], c(.025, .975))\n        2.5%        97.5% \n0.0002995732 0.1004690791 \nmean(GAMMA[aft.brn])\n[1] 0.04176755\nquantile(Gamma[aft.brn], c(.025, .975))\n        2.5%        97.5% \n0.0002995732 0.1004690791 \n\n\nBecause the two-sided Bayesian probability interval $(.00003, .0123)$ has its lower endpoint so near to 0, we also look at the one-sided interval $(0, .0110)$ for $\\pi.$  \n\nBecause we estimate the predictive power $\\gamma$ of a positive test at each step of the chain, we capture its values in order to get a 95\\% Bayesian probability interval $(0.0003, 0.1005)$ for the predictive power $\\gamma$ of a positive test. If we were to sequester subjects that get a positive result with this test, then only a relatively small proportion of sequestered subjects would actually be infected.\n\nDiagnostic Plots. Not all Gibbs samplers converge as\nanticipated. Diagnostic plots show that this one does. \n\n\nA plot of successive values of $\\pi$ shows the nature of the convergence of the Markov chain. The history plot of $\\pi$ shows that the chain 'mixes well'; that is, it moves freely among appropriate values. There are no points of\nnear-absorption. \nThe trace of running averages of the $\\pi_i$ shows smooth convergence to prevalence 0.0049.\nVertical blue lines indicate the burn-in period.\nThe ACF plot shows that the $\\pi_i$ are not independent. Among the $m = 100\\,000$ values, perhaps there are 1000\nindependent ones. In many Gibbs samplers, Markov dependence 'wears away' more rapidly than here. \nThe plot at lower-right is a history plot of the $\\gamma_i.$ \n\n\n\n\nVariations. If we run the same program with $\\eta = \\theta = .95,$ results are nearly the same as for the traditional procedure. If we have useful prior information (or opinions) about the prevalence, we can incorporate that information into the prior distribution on $\\pi.$\n\nReferences: (1)  Suess, Gardner, &amp; Johnson (2002), \"Hierarchical Bayesian model for prevalence inferences and determination of a country’s status for an animal pathogen\" Preventive Veterinary Medicine, and its references.\n(2) Suess &amp; Trumbo (2010) Probability simulation and Gibbs sampling, (Sect. 9.1), Springer.\n",

    "answer": "Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good\n\nMany of the issues you have raised are perfectly reasonable concerns.  Having said that, it is important to distinguish between cases where reported data is wrong, versus cases where reported data is correct, but is limited in its usage due to the omission of other relevant information.  The latter case is really quite ubiquitous in statistical analysis, since it is very rare that we have all the data we would ideally like to have.  In such circumstances, it is also important not to make the perfect the enemy of the good by presuming that the absence of a comprehensive dataset on every variable we would like to know about precludes any reasonable inferences being made from the data we have.\n\nThe main comprehensive public dataset we have available for the COVID-19 virus is the data held and updated by the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre at John Hopkins University.  This is the repository of data that is being used for the vast majority of media reports and data visualisations on the spread of COVID-19.  The database has data on confirmed infections, recoveries, and deaths, plus GIS data on where these occurred.  The data is sourced from the WHO and various national health departments, and it is being updated frequently.\n\nIt is certainly true that there are a lot of other things we would ideally like to have data about, to assist in understanding the path and severity of the virus.  As you have suggested, it would be wonderful if we could also obtaina comprehensive dataset on all the tests that have actually been conducted (including the negative results), and the characteristics of all the affected patients, including their age, sex, and health factors.   At this early stage it is probably overly ambitious to expect all of this data to have been collected and collated, but hopefully the various health departments of the world will eventually be able to bring some of this data together.  Health departments cannot legally disclose health information on particular patients in a way that would make them identifiable, so it is an extremely complex task to collate this type of data if the goal is to make it available for public analysis.  No doubt there will be some efforts to obtain and collate more detailed data, but it will be a difficult task.\n\nWhen interpreting limited data, it is desirable to describe that data in a way that makes it clear how it was collected, and this collection mechanism forms a caveat on analysis.  Thus, we can refer to the reported numbers of infections, recoveries, deaths, etc., from each of the reporting countries, while noting that there may be disparities from these figures to the actual true numbers.  Most health departments around the world are set up so that they can obtain these figures with reasonable accuracy, so that large diparities between reported figures and the true values are unlikely, except in the case of countries that make a deliberate effort to suppress this information.  Notwithstanding the lack of the ideal data you would like, from the reported data there are certainly some things that we can reasonably infer.  For most countries, the data is likely to be a reasonably representation of the number of infected, recovered, and dead patients out of those who have been properly tested.  (Of course, I take some of the data, such as the recent numbers from China, with a large degree of scepticism.)  It is also likely that there are other infected and recovered people who have not been tested, and who therefore do not form part of the reported statistics.  Even so, this data gives us a pretty good look at growth rates for the infection in various cities and countries around the world, which allows us to see where the virus has progresssed most rapidly, and where it has been relatively contained.  These numbers also allow some attempt at extrapolation, which allows health authorities to make predictions on the likely number of cases at future dates, and the health burden this will create in different places.\n\nYour question appears to assert that most of these trends are likely to be \"wrong\" due to the absence of data on other factors such as total testing and patient health.  In my view, that is not the correct way to look at it.  Rather, the reported trends may be correct, in the limited descriptive sense, but there may still be underlying non-reported factors that would give reason to anticipate future changes in those trends.  Personally, I am extremely impressed at how rapidly these various organisations have coordinated a large data collation and made public online platforms reporting on the infection and updating it frequently.  I can log on every day and see updated graphical information showing the progression of the infection in virtually any city or country in the world!  The data may not be perfect, but I would think it would bear enough of a resemblance to reality to be valuable information.  I think the effort is quite amazing, and it far past what we could do even ten years ago.\n",

    "answer_id": "459180",
    "answer": "I read from Strogatz's book that it was originated from modeling the human populations by Verhulst in 1838. Assume the population size is $N(t)$, then the per capita growth rate is $\\dot N(t)/N(t)$. By assuming the per capita growth rate descreases linearly with the population size, we can have the logistic equation of following form:\n$$\\dot N(t)=rN(1-\\frac{N}{K}),$$\nwhere $K$ is carrying capacity of the environment. From the equation, we can see that when $N$ is very small, the population grows approximately exponentially. As $N$ grows until half of the capacity, the derivative $\\dot N$ is still increasing but slows down. Once $N$ passes the half line, the derivative decreases so we can see a bending curve (we can see this actually from Coronavirus cases) and the population asymptotically approaches the capacity. Up to this point, we observe the properties of a logistic function. Intuitively, when $N$ is larger the capacity, the population decreases. By further mathematical simplification of the equation, we have an equation like this:\n$$\\frac{df(x)}{dx}=f(x)(1-f(x)),$$\nwhich has analytical solotion as:\n$$f(x)=\\frac{e^x}{e^x + C}.$$\nWith $C=1$ we have the logistic function.\n",

    "question": "Dr. Raoult, who promotes Hydroxychloroquine, has some really intriguing statement about statistics in the biomedical field:\n\n\n  It's counterintuitive, but the smaller the sample size of a clinical test, the more significant its results are. The differences in a sample of 20 people may be more significant than in a sample of 10,000 people. If we need such a sample, there is a risk of being wrong. With 10,000 people, when the differences are small, sometimes they don't exist. \n\n\nIs this a false statement in statistics? If so, is it therefore also false in the Biomedical field? On which basis can we refute it properly, by a confidence interval?\n\nDr. Raoult promotes Hydroxychloroquine as a cure for Covid-19, thanks to an article about a study on 24 patients. His claims have been repeated a lot because of for this study, but mainly in the mainstream media, not in the scientific press.\n\nIn machine learning, the SciKit workflow states that before choosing any model, you NEED a dataset with at least 50 samples, whether it be for a simple regression, or the most advance clustering technique, etc., which is why I find this statement really intriguing.\n\n\n\nEDIT: some of the answers below make the assumption of no result bias. They deal with the concept of power and effect size.\nHowever it seems there is a bias in Dr. Raoult data.

    "answer": "I agree with many of the other answers here but think the statement is even worse than they make it out to be. \n\nThe statement is an explicit version of an implicit claim in many shoddy analyses of small datasets. These hint that because they have found a significant result in a small sample, their claimed result must be real and important because it is 'harder' to find a significant effect in a small sample. This belief is simply wrong, because random error in small samples means that any result is less trustworthy, whether the effect size is large or small. Large and significant effects are therefore more likely to be of the incorrect magnitude and more importantly, they can be in the wrong direction. Andrew Gelman refers to these usefully as 'Type S' errors (estimates whose sign is wrong) as opposed to 'Type M' errors (estimates whose magnitude is wrong). Combine this with the file-drawer effect (small, non-significant results go unpublished, while large, significant ones are published) and you are most of the way to the replication crisis and a lot of wasted time, effort and money. \n\nThanks to @Adrian below for digging up a figure from Gelman that illustrates this point well: \n\n\n\nThis may seem to be an extreme example but the point is entirely relevant to the argument made by Raoult. \n",

    "title": "How to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak while organizing a conference?",
    "question": "I am an organizer for a graduate student conference in Mathematics occurring in April. My co-organizers and I are debating on a plan for what to do if the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States worsens. Right now, most of the participants are from states with no confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but this may change rapidly as the situation develops between now and the conference.\n\nThis is an issue other conferences throughout history have surely had to deal with, so I wanted to ask StackExchange if there were any best practices around for dealing with an issue like this. Some questions:\n\n\nHow far out should the go/no go decision be made? If the conference is late April, should we be planning to let participants and speakers know by early April so they can cancel flights and so on?\nWhat criteria should best inform whether we cancel or not? Number of cases in the participants' states for instance?\nIn the event we are to cancel the conference, how can we still give the speakers a chance to advertise their results? Have there been successful \"video conferences\" before where the organizers collect video for each talk and then upload them and participants can make comments? \n\n",

    "answer": "Regarding remote conferences, these have been successful. Often the motivating factor has been mitigating climate impact. For example, Yale Climate Connections wrote an article giving advice for running virtual conferences. Author Sara Peach presents three kinds of virtual conferencing, all of which have been done successfully: \n\n\nremote presentations in a traditional conference format. If people choose to not travel, they can still remote in or follow the session on social media. (Example: AGU)\nhub-based conference, where people gather in regional clusters. Each hub has some of its own content but are able to watch each other's presentations. (Example: International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition)\nan entirely remote conference, where people record and upload videos of presentations and conferencegoers have weeks to ask questions and interact. (Example: A Nearly Carbon-Neutral Conference Model)\n\n\nI'll add that an entirely virtual synchronous conference has also been done successfully. One example is NACADA, the Global Community for Academic Advising, which ran a 24-hour live-streaming virtual conference. \n\nThe mixed-conference or hub models may or may not be feasible, since they would still involve people gathering in some models, and you aren't sure yet whether that will be feasible on any scale. Also, developing regional hubs would take time you don't have.  Thus, if you decide to go entirely virtual, a synchronous-with-live-streaming conference and a asynchronous recorded approach have been done, and the resources linked should provide a way to start researching or planning that model. I also advise contacting your own IT department about the possibility. \n",

    "wrong_answer": "It is possible that there are some academic programs. They would be more likely at a Community College, I think. But you might be able to obtain an internship or apprenticeship at some custom publisher or even a major book publisher. \n\nTo find such an opportunity I'd suggest the following steps. Your local library has a need to re-bind books and knows who does that. Find out the contact information for such a service and, starting with them, work up the chain of contacts to the people who do the actual production. \n\nOther than librarians, you could also talk to a book-rep who visits your school or at an academic conference. Again, work up the chain of contacts to the production department. \n\nThere are a number of presses in the US who do custom small editions for authors and others. Thorndike Press in Maine used to be one of those, but I don't know if they still do it. But there are others. Search for Custom Publishing. But they may use suppliers of services and you will need to work to find who actually does the work. You are looking for, and may find, a company that actually uses hand crafting to bind books and even those that design the bindings using non-standard materials. \n\nIf you can find a really high quality book production outfit, you might explore either an internship or an apprenticeship with one of them. It might be paid or not. But even an entry level regular position will give you an opportunity to learn the skills. \n\nAnother source, but harder to find, are individual artisans who design and manufacture their own books (poetry, art, ...). I met one within the past year at a craft fair. But a search for \"hand made books\" might turn up something. \n",

    "title": "Tips for transition to online classrooms given university shutdowns in response to COVID-19",
    "question": "Given the recent shutdowns of many universities across the world, there's an increased interest in online education techniques.\n\nIn my case, I am a TA for a quantum chemistry class, and I'm finding it daunting to transition to online teaching. At first, I got really excited because I thought of taking advantage of this situation to run a flipped discussion section: I'd record lectures in advance, and then have virtual office hours where students could Zoom/Skype/Google hangout with me and we discuss in the same chatroom (so everyone hears the conversation). \n\nHowever, in what I suspect to be an attempt to distance themselves from something nice and free/far cheaper (like edX) which has been doing this online routine for a long time, my university has required that we livestream our lectures/discussion sections. This is purportedly to be in the aim to make their online experience as college-like as possible, but it's problematic for multiple reasons. First, lectures are at 9AM EST... Do we expect students to tune in at 10 PM in Japan? Or 3 AM in Hawaii? \n\nSecond, we should use the silver linings present in this university shutdown: video lectures = students get to go back and re-listen to a part that confused them! From my perspective, this university requirement goes against an attempt to maintain normalcy: normalcy should not be defined as continuation of the same daily routine (impossible for many), but rather a continuation of helpful instruction.\n\nI intend to find out whom to email about this, but in the meantime, what resources/advice would you suggest for an instructor who suddenly has to transition to the digital classroom?\n",
    "answer_id": "145371",
    "answer": "This is marked for community ownership so constructive edits will be welcomed. It is, however, more directed at those who can design a course, rather than a TA who has limited control. \n\nBackground\n\nMany of the teaching techniques we use are not optimal for learning. They have been designed for economic efficiency since they scale. Some of them have been a bit obsolete since the creation of the internet. But face to face classes in real time are no longer necessary. Lecture is efficient (one teacher, many students, synchronous), but again, not optimal. Testing is a poor way to guarantee competence. This current emergency can be considered to be an opportunity to rethink everything we do toward finding better ways to educate people. We are forced to act and the old ways don't work in a new environment. We should be looking for new ways. \n\nThe essentials of teaching are Delivery, Practice, Feedback, Assessment. All of these require Two Way Communication. They don't require synchronicity or exams. The first job is to teach people, not to grade them. If you get that part backwards then you are only \"teaching\" people who don't need to be taught. \n\nEvery student is different. Nearly every student learns differently from the way their instructor does. The instructor has been proven to stand out in a particular system in which others have failed. As an instructor you have an obligation to every student willing to put in the effort, not just to the ones naturally predisposed to \"win\" in some system. Not every student starts at the same place with the same understandings. The same words don't necessarily have the same meanings to different people. \n\nSome people have handicaps that prevent certain kinds of interactions. Hearing impairment and vision impairment are obvious ones, but there are others. \n\nLearning is individual, but the process need not require isolation. It can be a communal process with learners helping each other. Denying students the option of working together is sub-optimal. A course can be a communal activity, not a hierarchical one. \n\nSome students will succeed no matter the system. They don't really need you for anything more than pointing to important sources/ideas. But most actually require your assistance since insight into a topic can be hard to come by. Many students actually need to be taught how to learn. If you change the system of learning they may need to be retaught how to internalize ideas and turn them into competencies. It isn't automatic or obvious. \n\nLearning isn't \"consuming\" material. It requires active participation. It requires a change in the brain (The Art of Changing the Brain by James E Zull)\n\nAll of these things have long been taken into account in designing educational systems, but the current practice is a compromise that values economic (scale) values over educational ones. Not everywhere, of course, but the exceptions seem few to me. \n\nLet's assume that everything is on the table, except that students and instructors can no longer meet face to face in groups. Meetings of any kind need to be small and optional with alternatives provided. Computer communication of some kind is needed, but costs are an issue as is the privacy of all participants. \n\nWhat to do, what to do. \n\nIdeas for Delivery\n\nThere are a lot of ways for students to have access to the material of a course. Books are traditional. Lecture has replaced most other methods. But lectures are longer than they need to be. Some research I read suggests that lectures of 10 to 15 minutes are more efficient than hour or longer lectures (https://spokenimpact.com/what-is-the-ideal-length-for-a-presentation/). Those contemplating video should take note of that. Video also needs to be accompanied with a transcript to aid those with impairments. \n\nMoreover, students need to be able to review material. Video is difficult in this regard since it is hard to quickly return to a small part that needs review without watching longer sections, which leads to boredom. Transcripts can mark the time that important ideas are introduced. \n\nThere is a fine line between having good and poor production values in video. If they are too good, a video talk becomes just entertainment with poor learning, unless other means are used to encourage/enforce engagement. If they are too bad, then students will get lost and frustrated. Video professionals are good at this sort of thing, but it is hard to bootstrap immediately at scale.\n\nDelivery alone is just media. Students need to incorporate what they see in a lecture, long or short, into their long term memory and into their effective competencies. More is involved than the eyes and ears. Students often think that the will automatically \"learn\" what is presented to them in a lecture, talk, demonstration, etc. but it is anything but automatic. \n\nCaveats: Any \"solution\" that requires real-time synchronous presence on the internet will probably fail. And it will fail invisibly for some. Connections are dropped, servers overload, etc. It is hard enough to keep students off their phone when in a class. It is probably impossible to do in a real-time internet lecture. Other distractions will intrude. Moreover, unless you have an exceptional communication system, students won't be able to interrupt you when you make a mistake, as you will. No questions are likely to be asked in real time. It is also difficult for a presenter to give a lively talk with no audience feedback at all. Especially if you are trying to do this under emergency conditions without training and experience.  \n\nBut if you absolutely must use synchronous delivery you need to do two additional things. The first is that you need to record and post your lectures so that those who must miss the original don't lose access. \n\nThe second, just as vital, is that you provide a real time feedback to yourself (or to an assistant sitting by your side) so that questions can be asked as you lecture and so that students have a way to mention/note errors you make. \n\nAnd make sure that students know what to do in the case that you lose the server and the ability to broadcast. Avoid chaos and uncertainty as much as possible. \n\nIdeas for Practice\n\nStudent practice exercises and tasks may not need to change much. Students, depending on the field, need to write, solve problems, and other things as appropriate. For the most part this can probably proceed largely unchanged. Instructors have access to many such student exercises. If the students have a text book they probably have a bank of suitable exercises and questions. \n\nAnd note that practice and reinforcement is probably the most important element in a delivered education. The \"content\" that a student needs is, for the most part, available to them. There are exceptions for very advanced work, but the world's knowledge is pretty much available. Instructors help students choose the important things and avoid the garbage, of course, but it is up to the students themselves to learn by reinforcement (combined with feedback). Whatever the topic, competence comes from repetition and reinforcement. The only thing I teach nowadays is Tai Chi. We have a saying that you need to repeat a movement ten thousand times to learn it. Somewhere in those ten thousand tries, insight will start to develop. The same is true in things like mathematics and writing poetry. \n\nSo, remember that the things that you make the students do to learn are much more important than the things you say. Good course design focuses on the student tasks, not the lectures. \n\nI caution, however, that copyright considerations may apply if an instructor tries to utilize exercises from copyrighted material. They are, in a sense, publishing things they send to students in an online course. Caution and legal advice is useful. \n\nIdeas for Feedback\n\nFeedback is two way. You need feedback from the students on your presentations and assignments. Students need feedback on their own work. A number or letter grade on a paper isn't feedback. It gives no basis for understanding how to improve. \n\nIf the materials presented are well vetted, such as textbooks, the need for feedback to the instructor is a bit lessened. But videos, especially those prepared in the moment are likely to contain errors. Shorter videos are easier to fix than longer ones. But, unlike face to face classes, the instructor isn't likely to be interrupted when there is a misstatement or an omission. Moreover, you need some indication that the students have actually understood what you have been saying and presenting. Again, in fact to face classes you can look at expressions on their faces for some important feedback. \n\nLets assume for the moment that you have already taught your students the importance of taking notes during presentations. At the end of a lecture you can ask individual students, perhaps volunteers, to tell you an important idea from the talk. You can do this two or three times and give them feedback on their replies. This can be transferred to online learning. If readings or video presentations are short (and, I assume asynchronous) you can ask students to send you a summary of the lesson. Restrict them to one or two sentences. Another possible request is to ask them to send you a possible exam question on that material. At some point, all student replies, perhaps anonymized, can be made available to everyone. By glancing through the replies you learn whether they are getting the main points and they are also getting the reinforcement they need. \n\nGiving feedback to students on their work is critical to learning. This involves answering questions that they have, but also showing them where they are making mistakes, and why, in their own work. The previous section talked about repetition and reinforcement. It is possible for students to learn and reinforce the wrong message. If you get an incorrect idea deeply ingrained in your mind it can be difficult to dislodge. All student work needs to be commented on, not just graded. Publishing solutions to exercises after the fact can help, but it isn't the same thing. \n\nThis idea of individual feedback is one of the most difficult things to arrange in the modern educational system, simply because of scale. My university teaching (and student life) mostly involved classes of fewer than 30 students. At that scale, I could easily give good individual feedback on weekly assignments. At 40 students I found I needed help. Massive courses have a problem here that requires tools - probably better tools than are now available. I'll note that Harvard's CS50 course is delivered to about 800 students at a time. But the staff for the course is about 40 individuals, so the ratio is about 20:1. Some of the staff are graders who comment on student work. Others are TAs who hold individual \"recitation\" sections of 20-30 students so that questions can be answered and misconceptions dispelled. I worry that moving such recitation online might not work as well at scale unless there are communication tools that let people learn from the questions of others. Many students are reluctant to ask questions. The brave students willing to do so actually contribute to the education of their peers. But, answering a question for a single student, say in an office, is much less productive than answering it in public, so that all can share the response. Tools are needed for this, though they can be pretty simple. University managed email lists subscribed to by students and staff are pretty effective. \n\nBut if students produce \"papers\" of any kind, those need to be annotated and returned. More than a numeric or letter grade is needed. Something as simple as pointing a student to a place they need to review is helpful. But the goal is to foster insight. PDF files can be annotated and returned, but the process is awkward at best. And, again, there is the scale problem. It takes time to review and time to annotate. Then, the student will likely have questions that need to be addressed based on the annotations. The increase in awkwardness using current tools may require more staffing to make things work effectively. Even a simple email to a student takes more time than jotting a comment on a paper and then returning it at the next face session. \n\nIdeas for Assessment\n\nIn my view, evaluation and assessment are the most difficult issues we face in moving to an internet model. However, they also, again in my view, have the most potential for long term improvements in student learning, provided that we take the opportunity to learn how to do a better job of it. \n\nThe first principle of assessment ought to be that any sort of evaluation have an actual educational purpose, not just a \"sorting\" purpose. I think that many of us aren't doing a stellar job of this, having opted for easy solutions that scale, rather than solutions that aid student learning. Multiple choice tests are overused and while it is possible to design good ones, it is devilishly difficult. Things that rely on machine grading in general are too likely to also rely on only shallow learning and memorization, rather than deep learning and mastery. If the students can be held in a room and closely monitored this sort of thing tells you something about them, but it can likely be better. Move them outside your purview and it becomes nearly impossible. And it even fails at scale. \n\nWhile you can do some technological things to lock up a student's personal computer they are intrusive but also ineffective. You can enlist a vast army of TAs to monitor student webcams (intrusive, again) but even there, what happens slightly off screen is invisible. Without such intrusive measures students have access to helpers both human and electronic. Closed-book, closed notes exams are probably a mistake in any case, but online they are difficult to impossible to monitor. There are too many inducements for students to break the rules to really assure validity. Honor codes, such as those of Dartmouth College do have a positive effect, but part of that effect is that the codes have been in place for half a century. \n\nI have some personal suggestions about alternatives to examinations and, especially, high stakes examinations such as finals that account for a large fraction of a students grade. I don't claim these are the only solutions, but am more interested in sparking thoughts about how we can do a better - more learning focused - job of evaluation and assessment. I implemented these more and more as my career progressed and I learned more about students and about learning. \n\nThe first idea is to reduce the overall effect of any given exam or test. If you have forty small items you can get at least as good a picture of a student's progress as if you have only one or two large ones. Moreover, high stakes testing too often leads to poor student studying habits, such as cramming for exams and cheating. \n\nOne technique I used toward the end was \"cumulative grading\". A course had 1000 points assigned to it and different student activities were \"worth\" a certain amount of points. A project might be 100 points. The result was evaluated (and commented on) and a certain number of points was awarded, perhaps 80. I also published the minimum number of points necessary for each letter grade, say 800 for a B. When a student accumulates enough points to \"earn\" the grade they desire they no longer need to do more. There was no risk. Another feature of it was that if the student wasn't satisfied with the points earned they could re-do the work and possibly earn additional points. Some limits were put in place, but they were generous. The philosophy behind it is \"You aren't in this course to prove to me that you don't need to be here.\" But note that I could do this since the ratio of staff to students was good. This is hard to scale without help. \n\nThe second main technique I used and can recommend is to make almost all assessment and evaluation based on student writings and projects, not examinations. And, if the nature of the course permits, use group projects primarily. For my courses the group size was usually between two and five. These groups can meet in cyberspace or, if location and other factors permit, they can meet face to face. The projects might be large or small. They can be graded once or often. Points can accumulate. It is the project that is graded, not the individuals, so everyone earns the same grade unless that is impossible. Peer evaluation is used to award bonus points or to solve issues of non-participation, etc. \n\nIf there are a number of group projects students can move between groups if needed. But students also need to be taught how to run an effective group project. In the courses I taught, dividing up the work \"equally\" was always discouraged and if done, usually leads to poor outcomes. Students need to form teams, not just amalgamations of individuals. In CS this skill will be valued later in their careers. \n\nAlso, peer evaluation has to be properly managed. Students don't \"grade\" one another. They comment on the contributions of a few or all of their team mates. \"Who was the most helpful team member? (or three top members) Why? What did they contribute? What was your own chief contribution?\" \n\nAt a certain scale or with sufficient help you can easily determine who falls into which important grading groups. Who is excellent in all respects? Who shows promise? Who is getting by? Who is deficient? Who has failed? Elaborate point systems in which an 85 is somehow significantly different from an 87 have little real meaning in my opinion. \n\nTo emphasize a point above. In many fields, even very technical ones, writing is an important skill. Writing essays on a given topic is good professional preparation for a budding mathematician. Exams can be replaced with such essays, lessening the needs for security and such. They seem to me to be much more value long term than skill at exams. But you can probably expect that students will hate it initially. \n\nThe above, of course, are just ideas. But I found them to be more aligned with the teaching mission than the more traditional lecture and test. \n\nIdeas for Communication\n\nTo handle all of the above with online courses the main need is for effective communication between faculty and students and, I found, between students themselves. One goal is that what any student sees can be seen by any other student. \n\nCommunication tools need not be complex or comprehensive. But they should permit asynchronous communication and should permit many-way communication. Threaded email lists are very useful and don't require extensive facilities. They can be private lists, managed by the university alleviating some privacy issues, open to only class members and staff. Documents can be distributed. Questions can be asked. Questions can be answered at any time of the day or night - even by other students. Someone needs to monitor these to make sure that misinformation is quickly corrected and that any rules about posting or not posting certain content are maintained. \n\nIf project groups are long lived, then each group can have its own mailing list and can also use other tools they find for communication. \n\nAnother useful tool is a group chatroom. Group chats can be held periodically, though the email lists were more useful for discussing course material. These are necessarily synchronous and so not every student might be able to \"attend\". But it is easy to capture the complete conversation as a text file and send it to everyone or post it on a course web site. \n\n\n\nMy own expertise in this comes from helping to design and deliver a graduate program in which students met face to face only once a month for half a day per course. All work was done in groups (of about 5). Face time was only used for things that could not be done on line. We used simple tools for communication. All student-professor communication (other than personal things) was open to all students. Students could ask questions at any time and other students were encouraged to answer from their own expertise. The course was always live, every hour, every day. Questions got answered quickly, if not always perfectly. Students didn't get stuck. The goal was to build a learning community. That community has persisted past graduation. \n\n\n\nMinor updates only anticipated. \n\n\n\nAn interesting alternative view can be found here:  https://anygoodthing.com/2020/03/12/please-do-a-bad-job-of-putting-your-courses-online/.

    "question": "There has been a lot of talk about online teaching in relation to covid-19 and campus shutdowns.\n\nThis question isn't about that though: my question is about what ways online examinations should be treated in counterpoint to written examinations. \n\nI'm going to be transferring my course's written examination into an online environment. This examination involved 2 hours of students, with a pen and paper, answering questions both short and long in a typical examination environemnt.\n\nAn online exam however cannot be policed. Demanding it be anything other than open book is unrealistic. What methods can be deployed such that it is a genuine test of students' knowledge and capabilities?\n",
    "answer_id": "145495",
    "answer": "First, a two hour time limit might be difficult to enforce or to guarantee, especially if it uses a real-time clock. At some level of scale you may start to find that some students didn't get the exam paper or were unable to return it by the deadline. So, I'd start by rethinking if a time limit of less than a day is really essential to your exam. \n\nSecond, you can pre-vet any questions you ask by doing searching yourself online for possible answers and responses. Reject questions that have too much online presence, or be prepared for getting that back as answers. Presumably the test isn't about effective online searches. \n\nThird, give up the idea of asking students for facts. That is obvious, I'd think, as facts are cheap. But even facts requiring computation, such as in mathematics or statistics can be generated with tools such as MatLab or Mathematica. \n\nThe best sort of questions, I think, are those that require either or both of interpretation and insight. Questions about the why of things rather than the what and how are much better. However, these are the hardest to create, the hardest to answer, and are likely to have the widest variation in quality from students. To grade them might require quite a lot of interpretation: does this student show any insight at all into the subject? Pass-fail grading can be considered. Repeat attempts can be considered. \n\nAs an alternative to an exam, you can consider individual portfolio development by students. Students write or otherwise create some artifacts according to some criteria. Plagiarism concerns come in to play here, of course. \n\nI'll note that honor codes can help to a certain extent, though provide no guarantees. And honor codes created in the moment are probably less effective than those of long standing. \n",

    "wrong_answer": "I believe what you're talking about is the issue of tuition waivers: that is, are students obligated to pay fees for the tuition, or are those handled by the university.\n\nIn many countries in central Europe (including Scandinavia, Benelux, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria) PhD studies are actually paid employee positions, so what tuition charges exist are small, since students normally don't have to take many courses as part of the PhD program (international students may need to register for a few classes to satisfy qualification requirements, but it's not a coursework requirement per se). In other locales, such as as some programs in the US, grants cover tuition charges as well as stipends, preventing students from having to pay those charges. And in many of those countries, the tuition fees amount only to a few hundred euros, not tens of thousands.\n\nIt's only where students are expected to do large amounts of coursework and where no arrangements to remit or waive tuition are made that students are responsible for paying large amounts of tuition.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "Your question is based on a few statements which I believe are misunderstanding or over-generalisations.\n\n\n  Postdoc fellowships are only the external funds I (as an early-career postdoc) can secure.\n\n\nA fellowship is definitely the most significant external funding a postdoc can typically secure. If you manage to get such a fellowship, you most likely will tick a \"funding\" box on your tenure-track application in most places. However, this is not the only type of funding postdocs can go for. You can bid for funds to attend conferences, you can often bid for smaller pots of money to organise workshops, conferences, and share knowledge in science fairs, exhibitions,  outreach events. You can also engage in knowledge transfer and get funding from industries or other end-users of your research. And of course you can collaborate with established professors and get your name as a Co-Investigator or sometimes second PI on the grants they submit.\n\n\n  Teaching opportunity is also limited.\n\n\nThis is true, in principle: postdocs' main aim is to do research and they normally are not expected to teach more than 20% of load. However, although there is a time restriction, it does not limit one's ability to engage fully with various ways teaching is or can be done. If you only do marking for 20% of your time, that does not tick the \"teaching\" box so well. But if you also conduct tutorials, occasionally deliver a lecture or two, design a (part of) the assessment, contribute a bit to designing the teaching materials, it presents you much better as a well-rounded person who can be put in front of students and trusted with a course. If you also have or start work towards a recognised teaching qualification - even better.\n",

    "question": "During these unprecedented times, it is quite hard to predict whether any recently advertised academic jobs will be still available next fall, as some countries might enforce social distancing or lockdown for a whole year. Still, many conferences are cancelled or delayed this year, thus getting papers published harder, alongside with academic path progression. I guess that we should be trying to get journal papers accepted instead...\n\nGiven that I am at the end of a fixed term assistant professor position (looking possibly forward for an open term/tenure track one), I'm asking if it will be possible that universities will still be hiring new APs when they might be asked to close until further notice (e.g, UK). Is it still possible that some degrees will convert all of their modules  into on-line classes (e.g., for Computer Science), thus allowing universities to get the same number of students they expected in the following academic year? This is still a relevant question - I think -, as the hiring of new junior accademic staff goes hand in hand with an expected increased amount of students on campus.

    "answer": "The road to the future is never smooth and upward trending. It is bumpy. In the current chaotic situation, expect chaos in the short term. Others, such as myself, have experienced career setbacks due to circumstances we can't control. I finished my doctorate at a time when the market for mathematicians was one of zero demand and massive supply. But over time, the bumps eased out for us. Perhaps, and we hope, they will for you also. But prediction of the future is an uncertain business riddled with errors among fantastic claims. \n\nUnfortunately too many governments around the world are behaving incompetently, making everything worse. But in the long run, climate change will probably have a bigger effect than the current pandemic. And it is also being ignored by some governments. \n\nHowever, unless we are willing to give up scientific study altogether and unless we are willing to give up educating the citizenry for the future, there is a lot of incentive to continue as we have as much as we can within the constraints that we see. Universities have many incentives to maintain their services and their structures. Most feel an obligation to faculty, students, society, and science itself. Those are strong positive forces. \n\nThe incentives, however, need to be met with action. We don't have answers yet to some important questions. One of the questions is how meaningful and complete we can make an education without face to face interactions. Another is how we can continue some sorts of research, say lab sciences, without physical labs staffed by researchers. These are hard questions. It will take some innovation. Conferences could, in principle, move to virtual space, just as \"classroom\" education is doing now. \n\nFortunately we are in a better place today than even 20 years ago with fairly ubiquitous internet communication. Some of the problems are probably solvable relatively quickly. \n\nBut we don't know how many students will seek higher education in the next couple of years. We don't know how taxing authorities will deal with funding education in the face of economic disruption. Some, but not all, signs are positive. But uncertainty is high. Budgets, needs for faculty, working conditions, etc. All in flux. \n\nI suspect that the careers of people in your situation will be disrupted for a while, as mine was. But I also suspect that the situation will improve for you, though it may take some years to do so. Provided, of course, that we don't kill the planet along the way. \n\nTry to find a way to be healthy and happy, even if your short term goals must change. Try to use the internet to stay connected. Try to stay as productive as possible given the constraints. Apply for what positions there are, and for positions that you might not have considered if times were better. \n",

    "title": "Should I be worried about low undergraduate grades during the COVID-19 crisis affecting grad school admission chances?",
    "question": "I'm currently in my undergraduate junior year studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada. I'm hoping to apply for Top 10 US grad schools in mechanical engineering in about 18 months. In response to the worldwide COVID-19 health crisis, our institution has (as have most academic institutions) switched to online teaching and made many changes to the structure of our courses to accommodate the situation.\n\nAs part of these changes, the university has offered students the option to selectively change the grade reporting on their transcripts to CR/NCR (Credit/No Credit) at the end of this semester. Normally, my grades would be pretty good (hovering around ~3.9 GPA) and I wouldn't bother to report my grades as a CR instead of as a percentage, but this crisis has completely disoriented me and made it difficult to focus on my studies.\n\nFurthermore, the university has allowed instructors to retroactively adjust the course breakdown/weighting away from the original syllabus--this means that tests/projects that were originally worth 15% of the grade might have been increased to upwards of 40% weighting. This has had a negative impact on my course grades as well, as I was hoping to make up for poor showings on some of these lower-weight deliverables with strong final exam performances. Instead, these final exams are going to be worth much less now.\n\nIn the aftermath of these changes, I'm contemplating using the CR/NCR option on some of my course grades, particular with any grade that ends up lower than my current GPA. However, I'm worried about how this will be interpreted in my grad school admissions in a couple years. In normal circumstances, I think changing a percentage grade into a CR/Pass grade would be a red flag that a student's performance in the class was less-than-stellar.\n\nGiven the COVID-19 crisis and its effects on academia as a whole, are admissions committees two years down the road likely to be understanding if I decide to take advantage of the CR option now? Should I make use of it and explain that this was \"the coronavirus semester\" in my application package, or am I dooming myself by converting my grades from percentage into CRs?\n",

Furthermore those receiving grades and such will understand that the situation was chaotic and that the ordinary procedures need to be modified. \n\nIf it were me, I'd probably opt for the grades rather than pass/fail. If necessary, I'd just explain that the general chaos affected my performance somewhat and the grades may not accurately reflect my potential. I'd suspect that letter writers would back that up. But that is partly because I'd have a history of excellent performance generally and not one that would be questioned in the absence of the current situation. (This is the hypothetical me speaking, not the real me.)\n\nBut the pass fail option can also be explained fairly easily that the risks were higher due to general disruption and you considered it the safer option as the rules were changing, making earlier assumptions invalid. \n\nI expect that there will be more emphasis put on interviews and on letters of recommendation for a while until things settle down again.

(The grant is offered by a foundation that focuses on capacity-building support for non-profits in the city where I live.) Because of the impacts of COVID-19 on the non-profit sector (i.e., many of our organization's donation funds are likely to dry up), our hired consultants have generously offered to do their work pro bono. \n\nHere's my question: what is the etiquette of letting a grant funder know their funds are no longer needed for a specific project? To clarify, I was pretty far into the grant writing process (original LOI / project proposal approved, directed to the next steps in the application process) when we learned we'd no longer need the funds for the consultation fees. (The foundation that has offered the funds is a major donor to local non-profits, so there is a good chance that we'll be applying to them again in the future--just for a different project.) Since I corresponded a lot with a representative of the foundation, I feel like I should follow up to let them know, especially as we may be applying to them again in the future ... what are others' thoughts on this issue?\n\n(If there's a better StackExchange community for posting this question, I apologize!)\n",

    "answer": "I would ask the representative. Procedures differ wildly from funding agency to funding agency. \n\nHowever, I would not be worried: everybody acted in good faith, and you are asking for less money. So in all likelihood the response will just be a short email thanking you for letting them know, and telling you that they look forward to receiving new applications from you in the future.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "I can provide some information about the US, and maybe a bit of perspective.\n\nFirst note that the process of doctoral education is quite different in the US and parts (at least) of Europe. I'll focus mostly on things such as CS and mathematics. It may be different in other fields. \n\nIn the US, there is a relatively low bar for acceptance into a doctoral program. An undergraduate degree is all that is normally required, though some institutions may expect more. Not only that, but a four year undergrad program in the US is a generalist degree, not a specialist one. The \"major\" subject is between 1/3 and 1/2 of the total coursework and not every student is much exposed to research. \n\nMoreover, most doctoral students in the US in these fields are, in a sense, self funded, as they are employed by the university mostly as TAs (sometimes RAs). Universities with doctoral programs in math and CS, also normally teach a lot of undergrad students, which means either lots of small classes or larger classes with lots of TAs. There aren't normally enough regular faculty to teach all of the courses, so they depend on doctoral students to help. \n\nIn Europe, I suspect that the bar is higher for entry, with more courses and research experience expected. I also suspect that doctoral education there is somewhat less dependent on student teachers and assistants. In some places, doctoral students are regular employees, and may, therefore, also be teachers. \n\nBut, I think you need to expect that no matter where you are, that doctoral education is a full time endeavor. You can \"have a life\" with outside interests, but your full time \"job\" is directed toward your degree. The exception would be for someone who can do a degree part time on their own funding. These are rare. And, I think that \"full time\" normally means more than 40 hours per week. Most people make sacrifices in that way and require that other family members are willing to accept that. It isn't so much that it is demanded of you, though it might be, but that research isn't a regularized process. There is no way to say that in X course I will achieve Y results. Insight is precious. \n\nWhether the \"time to degree\" differs depends on how you measure it. From the end of a secondary education to a doctorate is likely about the same anywhere. There are things that need to be learned and research that needs to be done and reported. Whether you count that as part of a specialized undergraduate degree, or an MS degree, or doctoral education, matters little. Since the starting point is about the same, and the end point is about the same, there are few shortcuts. \n\nSo, what is best for you, depends on where you currently are. If you have the prerequisites done for specialized research, then you want a program that will let you get to it. Otherwise you want something that will help you reach that point. \n\nI'll note, however, that, even in the US, if you are well prepared on entry, many doctoral programs will expedite your entry into research without a lot of course preliminaries. You need to pass exams and write a dissertation. You won't, most likely, be expected to repeat courses for which you are already well prepared, though you may need a way to demonstrate your competence. You will need funding, and, as an international student, few fellowships will be open to you. So you will probably be expected to teach or TA. If you are already an experienced teacher, you may have more advanced duties than most, but (student) visa restrictions can still get in the way. \n",

    "wrong_answer": "For what it's worth, I wouldn't consider (1) unreasonable - I'd consider it something that a strong student might well ask you. You're assessing them on their ability to be good at passing your exams. They're asking for more opportunities to get good at passing your exams by working hard and practising passing them. As long as all of the students have the same opportunities, that seems perfectly ok - they might all learn things by doing that. The counter-argument that a student might get good at passing your exams but not good at the underlying techniques can surely only be an indictment of your exams as a measure of their abilities - a high mark in an exam should imply strong skills, or what's the point? If the issue at hand is that you might want to repeat questions from previous years in your exams (which it seems to be, given that you're talking about memorisation), maybe that's the real problem, and it might be worth thinking about just making new/more original questions? If you do that, then you can share more past papers and solutions with all of the students without causing yourself any real problems.\n\nConversely, (2), (3) and (4) are clearly more likely to be asked by weak students who want to avoid having to learn all of the material. To those students, I would simply say that since the purpose of the course is to make sure that they've learnt all of the material covered, and telling them which bits to ignore would defeat that purpose, you're not going to do that, and you recommend that they learn the whole course thoroughly to put themselves in the best possible position to get a good mark.\n",

    "question": "As a response for the Covid-19 pandemic, my university built an electronic platform, and is now ordering professors to share their courses on it. \n\nThe school platform is open to the public, so I'd rather not share my documents on it. I've been using Google Classroom to share content with my students. \n\nCan I rightfully refuse to use the school's platform?\n",
    "answer_id": "147510",
    "answer": "\n  Can I rightfully refuse to use the school's platform?\n\n\nTL;DR: legally, probably not, but you are still more or less in the right according to the norms of academia.\n\nLonger answer:\n\nThis isn’t so much about rights in the legal sense. The underlying context is that there is a longstanding tradition in academia that faculty own the rights to written (and other) media they create as part of their work. This is the case in the US where these rights are pretty universally respected as far as I’m aware, and in many other countries, and is true despite the fact that legally, in the US at least, employers in general can (and, outside of academia, generally do) assert ownership of all intellectual property generated by employees in a work context.\n\nIn other words, academic institutions have quite intentionally and explicitly given up some of the legal ownership rights they are in principle entitled to. As far as I understand, the guiding philosophy here is that faculty exercise a lot more freedom and control over what kind of materials they produce compared to employees in other sectors. That means the work is regarded as being of a more personal, creative nature, and it was decided long ago that that should mean that faculty would be the owners of the work. (Note: I am talking specifically about copyright; for other forms of IP like patent rights, a quite different philosophy and different policies typically apply.)\n\nComing back to your question: I think you are quite right to be concerned. Your university is at the very least showing itself as somewhat deaf to these very old and well-established ideas. But can you “rightfully refuse”? Legally, that’s less clear. But it would be quite reasonable to express a concern. At my university the administration has provided reassurance to faculty that their copyright over teaching materials would be respected during the COVID-19 crisis, and we were given quite specific explanations on how our rights would be balanced against the need to deliver our teaching remotely, including providing recordings, what steps we can take to prevent students from sharing our materials, and more. Perhaps by raising the issue you and your colleagues can push your own administration to also think this through a bit more.\n\nLet me finish by encouraging you to also adopt a more flexible and tolerant mindset. All of us are called upon these days to get out of our comfort zone and appear in online videos and recordings, use online platforms with awful records on privacy, and generally engage in activities that in normal times we might consider distasteful and privacy-violating. We do this with the understanding that exceptional times call for exceptional measures, and that the highest priority right now is to keep the lights on at our institutions. As I said, I think your concern is reasonable and probably you can reach some sensible understanding with your administration about your class materials. But while you discuss the issue with them, try to keep some perspective and not make yourself too much of a pain in the butt. As important and valid as this is, people do have worse things to worry about these days.\n",

My advisor has been great, and she is supportive. I am also satisfied with the progress being made in the project. \n\nDue to the increased visa denials, I was advised to wait for the next visa and not leave the US during the OPT period. The HR informed me that J1 is the only option as per the organization policy, and my advisor is powerless even if she wants to help. I did not know that non-University entities could sponsor J1 and thought H1B was the only choice (a significant reason for choosing this position; my bad.) \n\nIf I take J1, I will be subject to the two year home residency rule (which is the worst; the economy in my home country (a banana republic) is in shambles). Being on OPT would make it extremely risky to leave the US, and the status of the OPT STEM extension is uncertain. These factors make me want to look for new opportunities with H1B sponsorship.

    "wrong_answer": "Preliminary remark: There are differing opinions on the important of the GRE in admissions to postgraduate programs, and its weight largely depends on the preferences of the academics making admission decisions.  Some regard the GRE general test as useful information, and take it into account, and some regard it as unimportant.  Meta-analysis of the predictive validity of the GRE can be found in Kuncel et al (2001).  Nothing in this answer should be read as implying that the GRE is determinative of entry, but if you are going to submit scores on this test, or if you are required to do this, it is good if your scores compare favourably to your cohort of applicants.\n\n\n\nAssessing your score relative to your field of study: Assessing your score on the general GRE test can be done by comparing your score to data on the scores of test-takers, broken down by their intended graduate major.  Unsurprisingly, different fields have applicants with different levels of ability in the three sections of the GRE general test.  A score that would be considered good in some fields will be considered weak in other fields, depending on the average standard of applicants to that field.  Hence, it is important to look at your scores relative to the cohort of test-takers with your intended graduate major.\n\nThe Educational Testing Service (ETS) have published test data for test-takers (seniors and non-enrolled college graduates) who undertook the general GRE test in Financial Years 2014-17.  This data shows score outcomes for each group, based on their intended graduate major.  This data can be used as a reference to check how your score compares to other students who are intending to pursue the same graduate major as you.  It can also be used by academics to help them to interpret your score.  (ETS also produce annual 'snapshots' of score outcomes that give information on the scores across demographics and majors.)\n\nIf you would like to get a good idea of whether your GRE score compares favourably with your cohort (students seeking admission to study the same postgraduate major), the simplest thing to do is to compare your result to the published data for students in that cohort.  The data gives score frequencies in bins, so it is not usually possible to obtain your exact percentile in the cohort, but it should be possible to see roughly where you fall in that cohort.  The data also give means and standard deviations for the scores, so it is possible to obtain a standardised score relative to the cohort.\n\n\n\nExample: In this related question the test-taker was seeking entry to an applied maths graduate program, with GRE general test scores of VR 167 (98%), QR 161 (78%) and AW 5.0 (93%).  This can be compared with histograms of scores from this cohort taken from the aforementioned data (means and standard deviations are also given in the data):\n\n\n\nIf we place the scores of this student into the data for the cohort of test-takers seeking entry to an applied mathematics graduate program we see that his quantitative reasoning score is actually below average for this cohort, despite being substantially above average relative to all test-takers.  The standardised scores for this student (standard deviations above/below the mean) relative to this cohort is VR 1.875, QR -0.500, AW 1.875.\n\nThis result shows that this particular student has a lower quantitative reasoning score than the majority of the cohort, and so this is likely to be a weakness of the application (to the extent that GRE is considered).  This is unsurprising when considering the fact that applicants for mathematics programs tend to have extremely high levels of quantitative reasoning ability.\n",

    "answer": "Absolutely. Journals are ways of disseminating scientific information, and they do take into account what is of current interest.\n\nMore specifically, however: Both Science and Nature do not just publish scientific articles, but also commentary and news stories. For example, in Science they are in the \"News\" and \"Perspectives\" parts of the magazine, and they definitely cover current events. As, if I may add, they should.\n",
    "answer_type": "Reasonable",
    "wrong_answer": "When your question bears the underlying motive/question, if it easier to publish in nature and science in the next years by doing research on this topic, then my answer would be no. There will likely be an over-proportional amount of COVID-19 related papers be published in top-tier magazines, but at the same time an enormous amount of additional funding money will flow into biomedical research institutes and create competition to solve this problem in a kind of competition, while many biometdical researchers and drug developers have already stated that the development of a remedy against COVID-19 will take 1-2 years. As Buffy commented above and I conclude, the review likely becomes and should much more rigorous for COVID-19 related papers. Additionally the submission rate and competition to get into review will rise. \n\nI'm aware of several retractions in nature magazine covering biomedical breakthroughs over the past years. Many retractions related to COVID-19 would not be very advertising for a journal within a reproduction crisis within academia.\n\nI also want to mention that really important and technical papers are not only published in top-tier journals like nature and science, often the authors also choose intentionally a journal within the community to fasten the progress and reach the biggest possible dissemination. In case of COVID-19 a journal most of the researchers within a community have access to and which offers a format allowing the authors to transport the content they think is necessary to disseminate in the fastest and most completest way with short review time (which is often much longer among nature and science) to the community is probably a much better choice to save human lives.\n\nIt's a delicate question when the research question affects million of lives within a short time period, what ethically the right publishing and reviewing  behaviour should be amoung authors and journals. There are of course preprints for nature and science, but do nature and science really have the best specialists, reviewers and review system for solving a very specific scientific problem within short time or rather journals that cover since decades virus deseases? I'm at least wondering if COVID-19 will also create new ways of publishing/commenting of researchers worldwide within short-time on a very high quality level and with open-source access. \n\nSo I'm skeptical about @Wolfgang Bangerth's answer if Nature and Science should prioritize COVID-19 papers without changing their review system/duration and if both magazines are the best place to publish such papers concerning the importance of a fast progress in R&amp;D. This depends really a lot upon how biomedical researchers share information in the fastest way via specific journals with short but rigorous review while retaining a high reproduction rate of the results.\n",

Unless you want to video-monitor students, you can also not prevent students from using a second computer, a virtual machine, or having somebody else working on their computer for them. And even then you need at least two cameras to see everything that the student is doing or that is happening to them and you would have to frequently check that they are working themselves, did not rig the video, etc.\n\nOn a more general level, controlling cheating on any exam that is based on limiting resources is already difficult if you do it in a setting that you can control (i.e., your room, your computers, your toilets, etc.).\nBy taking this battle to the “enemy’s territory” and limiting your knowledge, you can only lose.\n\nI would thus suggest the following alternative.\nThis is how my programming practicals were done when I was a student.\nI also successfully applied this to a programming “exam” in a course I co-organised.\n\n\nThe students do the programming practical with no restrictions except time.\nFor example, they may use the entire Internet, course material, etc.\nAfter they submit the code, there is a short oral exam on the code.\nDepending on the details of your course, you can very this exam in length and relevance, with the extreme examples being:\n\n\nYou grade the code and the oral exam only serves to ensure that the students didn’t cheat (and may be as short as five minutes).\nYou only check that the code is doing what it’s supposed to do, while the oral exam determines the grade and may also contain questions about other aspects of the course and deeper understanding.\nHere, the oral exams may cost more time, but you also spend less time looking at their submissions.\n\nIf applicable, also perform plagiarism checks on the code.\n\n\nSome pros and cons of this approach:\n\n\nYou somehow have to organise remote oral exams, but these could be just via the phone, if that suffices to establish the examinee’s identity for you. Also be prepared that this mode will amplify anxiety, language, and other issues for some students (while it reduces them for others).\nYou may need to modify your tasks to account for full Internet access and similar, for example it should not be anything to which a bazillion of solutions exists.\nDepending on your topic, this may be very difficult.\nThe exam is more realistic: except for taking exams, your students will have Internet access for the rest of their career and using it properly is also a relevant skill.\nThe oral exam allows you to gauge actual understanding, whereas the purely written exam may be solved by rote-memorising algorithms, etc.   \nIn case of group work, you do not need to worry much about some incompetent student benefiting from a stronger partner.\n(I am aware that this point doesn’t apply to you; I mention it only for completeness.)\n\n",

If it is in your main list, you need to ensure that numbering and sequencing is not affected.

But I wonder if the faculty are sealing their fate, being so helpful when there is a counterparty, the administration, that may not have the faculty's best interests at heart (note, I have no direct knowledge either way). \n\nSpecifically, barring any big disasters in remote teaching these next weeks/months, I would guess 1) smaller schools close to insolvency, many of which have closed these last few years, would instead have an opportunity to cut costs by dispensing with or heavily decreasing in-person instruction, without facing the PR issues or other pushback that would otherwise bring, and 2) even in schools with secure finances, or where it is unrealistic to get rid of in-person instruction, professors would lose a lot of bargaining power in any negotiations with the administration, since they will be regarded as that much less necessarily. Possibly the next few weeks/months will demonstrate that the professors are in fact less necessary, and remote learning is perhaps preferable. I am not really asking about that, my question is more selfish as someone going on the job market soon. Are these outcomes likely? This type of concern must be on the radar of professors' unions, no?\n",

    "answer": "Well, based on the 3 institutions I have close contact with, their attempts in the past few weeks hardly represent a shining example of hugely successful online learning! It feels more like the Keystone Kops!\n\nThat bit of snark out of the way, effective teaching in the online/MOOC/e-channel, etc. is not easy, and making the transition between a face to face course and an effective online course requires a lot of thought and a lot of design a prep, which of course no-one has has time to do this time around. So my snark was not meant as a true criticism, but at the same time, it means that mainstream universities' efforts in the balance of this semester are themselves unlikely to make anyone -- teachers or learners -- say, \"hey, that went really well; let's dispense with classroom instruction altogether\".\n\nThat being said, I do think this will strongly accelerate the shift towards e-learning in the medium- and long-term, and that in 2 ways.\n\n\nIn the long term, this will make e-learning a much more mainstream offering that students and faculty will become more comfortable exploring and integrating into the curriculum. Forced immersion brings familiarity and less fear. Up to now, in North America at least, we tended to have old-school in-person institutions, a few more e-learning focused disruptor institutions, and a select few dabbling in MOOCs layered on top of their usual approach. There was a lot of mutual mistrust. That will lessen. And just like a greater degree of teleworking throughout the economy, with the Pandora's box on it opened, will persist past current social isolation, so will demand for -- and willingness of faculty to explore -- e-learning.\nNext year, there will be a lot of financially and emotionally wounded students, whose life plan took a pretty big hit. Some will be keen and able to return to their university campuses and continue as before. Some won't be, and when they get their affairs in order a few years later, in a world that will have lived through months of forced virtual work and socialization, they will probably be keener to explore online offerings than they were previously. And the more they start work somewhere and become mature learners, or the more straitened their financial circumstances become, the more they will seek out good-value-for-money education with schedule and geographic flexibility, and the less they'll be keen to return and pay for the conventional on-campus student experience. Of course that won't apply to all, but I suspect to enough that it will make a difference at the macro level.\n\n",

    "question": "I am currently in a job in the US (on STEM OPT). I had a postdoc offer from a large US university that was supposed to start April 16. I signed an offer letter for a two year contract. We were in the process of deciding which visa to apply for (H1/J1). \n\nToday I got an email from the PI (HR copied) saying she would like to put the position on hold until things settle down. I asked for a clarification on what \"on hold\" meant and whether the offer letter was still valid. The HR replied this (PI copied):\n\n\n  As for the offer letter you signed (due to redacted’s current\n  situation) please consider it void until future notice.\n  \n  Professor [redacted] will contact you if you are still being considered\n  for the position.\n\n\nThis is the last communication I had with the HR or the PI.\n\nWhat does this mean? Since I have the signed offer, when things do settle down, is the university legally obligated to offer the position back to me before anyone else? Or the university is formally rescinding the offer and I should just move on? Can they do that? \n\nEDIT: Some answers have asked about my eligibility to work in the US. For clarification: I’m in the US now, in my current status, I can work in the US till the end of May. If the university applied for an H1B (which is typically approved for non profit), I could stay in the US as long as I didn’t leave the country (in which case I would have to get a visa stamped).

Moving on is probably your best option.  \n\nThere are two possibilities:\n\n\nThe university is unable to pay you, so they are forced to do something that could potentially cause them a lot of harm in the form of bad press or litigation.\nThey did this voluntarily or out of incompetence, in which case the university is a bad place to work and you are lucky not to be working there.\n\n\nIn either case, you should look for employment elsewhere.\n",

I currently am an adjunct only teaching one upper-division class at this institution.  The catch here is that my chair has asked me and the other part-timers to throw out numbers that we feel are appropriate.  I really have no intuition about what to ask for, or to simply respond (graciously) saying that I trust my chair's judgement and allow them to come up with a number for me/us.

Universities still have their mission(s): Teaching, Research, Service. That won't change unless the disruptions are much worse than are now foreseen or even likely. \n\nCourse delivery is being affected, but hasn't ended. Research goes on, though interrupted/slowed in some fields for safety. Funding for research is still in place and will probably continue. It will be a boon for some (biomedical) research. \n\nSome marginal colleges will be in trouble. Think Walden University from the Doonesbury comic, but they were in trouble before this began. Tenure Track professors are unlikely to be affected because they represent the future of the university, not some disposable resource. Postdocs have contracts and funding in place for the most part, often by grants. \n\nThere is even a chance that the current disruption will increase the need for faculty in the short term. \n\nBut for long term effects we need to see how the hundreds to thousands of variables now in play work out over time. And it will take time since universities have quite a bit of built-in inertia. Whether \"cheap online degrees\" have any actual value is something yet to be determined. And they may not be as cheap as you think. Some online programs are extremely expensive to create. And the issue of the actual qualifications of those who take them is important and, perhaps, doubtful. \n\nBut even if a university were to try to deliver such a \"cheap\" degree there is the question of still needing to do research and that requires highly qualified personnel. There isn't a \"cheap online research path\" that has and likelihood of success. \n\nDiploma mills have a poor history, being more associated with exploitation than with excellence. \n\nRelax. Stay healthy. Do a good job. Climate change is a bigger risk than what we are going through in the current months. \n\n\n\nSome people normally employed by colleges are at risk, of course. The people who clean the dormitories and prepare meals for resident students, for example. Lots of service jobs are at risk. Likewise, there are lots of small businesses in college towns that are at risk of failure, leaving their employees (including students) without resources. \n",

If there are too few jobs then people must look elsewhere or find a way to be more competitive themselves. \n\nThe issue you face is really only finding a job. To do that you have to be attractive to the ones offering the job. Math is a great background on which to build as it gives you analytic and deductive skills that can be brought to bear on many problems. But you can also appear over-qualified for some positions. \n\nBut if you want to work in specific fields, you probably need to get some qualification in those fields, even if it is pretty informal. Employers probably don't want to support you while you learn if it takes too long and there are other, better qualified, candidates. \n\nSome applied math or statistics might put you in a better position. \n\nBut you need to search out jobs, selecting those that best fit your skills, but also finding a way to promote your skills as appropriate. \n\nYou might, in fact, look for a \"bridge\" position, say as a postdoc, that gives you time and an opportunity to get some qualifications in an applied field that appeals to you. \n",

It isn't the same as face to face, but it can keep you engaged. \n\nBut at a minimum, write a lot and note where you have problems. Ask a lot of questions, but make sure they are pretty focused. Share what you write with your advisor, by email or by posting it somewhere. \n\nAsk your advisor directly how you are doing and ask explicitly for next steps. You will most likely get suggestions about reading. Take a lot of notes on the readings and note things that puzzle you.

What I am trying to do now is target other areas that will allow me to round out an application in the future. As an example, I am currently taking a Teaching &amp; Learning Program with the Graduate Studies department at my university and the program draws on the \"Science of Teaching and Learning\". In contrast to research papers, this type of thing may be minor, but I feel that developing these sort of auxiliary components to the overall application over time are all important. \n\nSo pursuing development to become a better educator (and this is because I actually want to, not because I feel compelled to) is one thing that I can do in the present to help prepare me for the future. I am wondering what some other things can be done over time (especially over the course of a PhD), that can contribute to a strong application aside from research activities. Below is a list of some things that I have thought of that could be developed over the course of a PhD that could A) help a future application or at least B) make my life easier down the road (haha). \n\n\nDeveloping a sample of introductory course notes for in class &amp; online learning (boo COVID-19)\nPursuing professional development activities in teaching and learning\nDeveloping introductions for certain technologies that have some relevance in my field, but can be overlooked at the undergraduate level (Programming Language or Geographic Information Systems)\nWriting tips and advice for undergraduate students \n\n\nI debated asking this question, because it sort of feels like a shopping question, although after some thought it felt like more of a professional development question. \n",

    "answer": "Actually the most important thing for you to focus on right now is getting a good research experience and a good relationship with an advisor. Get started on that. Learn to go deep into some subfield of your overall field. Gain expertise in that. \n\nAlong the way, if you want to be an academic, a bit of teaching experience will help, but will be more valuable for some positions than others. But without the \"gain expertise\" part it won't matter much. \n\nAnd I caution against trying to choose a field strategically based on what is going on this month. You will graduate, in several years, into a completely different job situation and it is impossible to predict how it will go long in advance. As you get closer to graduation, in four years or so in the US, you can start to broaden your skill set depending on the perceived needs at that time. \n\nBut some things are valuable in any case. Learning to do research. Learning to write. Learning to collaborate. Building a circle of potential collaborators.\n\nBut most of the details you suggest are just distractions at this time. Day 1 is the day you look seriously for the best advisor willing to work with you. \n",

Moreover, I don't think it is a big loss, since it sounds like your current adviser may not give you a good recommendation even if you stay with her. \n\nYou should be able to find a postdoc position based on your publications even without a letter from your current adviser. Your postdoc adviser can then write you a letter.

They can also explain the situation (i.e., why you did not work with the person in your department in your area).\nYou can bring in an external expert for your thesis committee. This allows an expert in your area to get to know you and your work.\nYou can meet people at conferences who might be likely to read your paper anyway (because they are working on related things) who might then be willing you write you a letter.\n\n\nGood luck!\n",

    "wrong_answer": "If you're planning to apply to graduate school in the next year or two and already have any ideas of prospective advisors you'd like to work with, I'd recommend reaching out to them by email to introduce yourself, tell them why you'd like to work with them, and ask whether they have any idea yet about how they will weight this when considering applicants. This has a few advantage:\n\n\nDepending on the field and program you're entering, acceptance into graduate programs can be much more a matter of an individual professor deciding to take you on as their student than any formal institutional views.\nAs such, you should absolutely be getting in touch with potential advisors before applying anyway--many professors don't even consider students who haven't reached out in advance before submitting an application.\nIt's never too early to get in touch, and showing that you're considering this well in advance and are eager enough to work with someone that you're reaching out to them now will reflect well and increase the chances that they'll consider your application more favorably (assuming it's solid) once you do apply.\n\n\nIf you don't know who you'd like to work with but have any ideas about schools you're interested in, you can also email their graduate advisor or dean of grad studies or whatever the person in that role is called there (although again, depending on the field and your career goals, you might want to pay more attention to individual advisors than schools).\n\nWith all the above as a disclaimer that the impacts of a P/NP grade will be highly variable and depend on individual schools and advisors... I'll also just say that many, MANY schools are now switching to P/NP options, so you will be far from alone in having a P or two on your transcript from this semester. I have a feeling most professors won't have much choice but to allow for this unless they want to discount pretty much all their applicants for the next few years. Also, to be blunt, an advisor/program that penalizes you for struggling or choosing your mental health over your grades this semester is probably an advisor/program to avoid. Especially if you're saying that a B would bring your GPA down, you can do better than that.\n\nFinally, I don't know your school's specific policy, but many are allowing you to switch from letter grades to P/NP right up until the end of the semester. So you might be able to wait and reevaluate your options after seeing how your grade is doing closer to the deadline. Good luck!\n",

For instance, if you got accepted to two programs and only could attend one, I would list both.

    "wrong_answer": "(Expanding my comment into an answer, as suggested by Bryan Krause.)\n\nI think it'd be unusual, and I honestly feel a little weird about it. Perhaps it can be done well, but consider how it would look before doing so. If you're using the quote in support of claims in your research statement, I'd wonder a) is there no support in the literature for that claim (why?), or b) if you're not confident in your own claims. If you instead hope to use the quote in support of your abilities or talent, I think it'd be better to ask the report writer to also write one of your recommendation letters. After all, if they wrote so in the viva report, chances are that they highly enough of you and your work to write a good letter. (It'd also look a lot better on paper than \"X said I'm awesome!\")\n\nThe second aspect to consider is if the quotes can be verified. In the systems I'm somewhat familiar with, these reports are usually not publicly available - at least not easily so. This means that those reading your application would likely be unable to confirm that the quotes are valid, making the value of including them kind of dubious. What's more, the report writers might have an expectation that the report isn't made public, and might disapprove of you using their words this way. (Now, you could of course solve that by asking them, but again, if it's central to your application, a recommendation letter would make the point more convincingly.)\n\nFinally, to address your second question: If you choose to do this, you could probably just cite it as company report or internal report, ideally adding a link if it's available online. If your university do make these reports public in a more official manner, it might also be classified as a technical report, but I sort of doubt it. Generally, however, exactly how you cite something in your application probably matters a lot less than what you cite.\n",

For the masters I have found this growing researcher who is doing amazing work and is eager for me to join his lab from the start of the program. Assuming that by the end of the MS, I get ~3.7GPA, a couple co-authored pub and 1 first authored pub in reputed journals along with going to conferences to present my work, altogether getting strong recommendations from the advisor and his colleagues. Will this in any way offset my u-GPA. Also apart from research in masters I have had about 2 years of research experience during undergrad (in and out of school) and have published a paper in a peer-reviewed journal. \n\nI am looking to get into the biomedical engineering PhD programs at university of chicago, northwestern university, university of pittsburgh, john hopkins university, york university, and university of pennsylvania. Do you think that I am aiming too high? If so, what else should I look to do to improve my chances? Also if I start MS this Fall should I apply for PhD at Fall 2022 or Fall 2023?\n\nAdditional Info:\n\n\nI did a decent undergrad thesis (not great, 8 months), soon after I did a 2 month internship a another research lab. During my undergrad I worked w/ a prof for 1.2 years (Got two papers out - one in a conf and another in a journal). Currently I am working in a top research lab, now remotely due to covid-19 outbreak.\nSome people have mentioned other questions thinking that those had the same information that I wanted. But, they did not as the questions talked about how to get into \"a/some\" PhD Program after a low U-GPA and maybe decent masters. The schools that I have mentioned above are ranked pretty high and  would appreciate if you could tailor your answers to my specific question of getting into these schools.\nI picked these school not to show of the \"rank\" or \"prestige\" which seems stupid honestly. I chose the because of the strength in the field (F1) that I'm looking to do research in. In one of my previous questions I had mentioned that I got a PhD offer from university of houston which does the research in F1 but it isn't very strong in other area such as: number of grants that they pull in to do amazing research on large patient populations, intellectual cohorts, and industrial connections and startup resources. I picked these schools as I believe them to be the best in F1 and NOT for the main purpose of prestige.

If someone has to make a choice between two candidates, the choice has to be made and lower priority things may bear some weight. \n\nHowever, the only way to know whether you have a problem is to actually make application to some places and then evaluate the feedback.

    "question": "Disclaimer: My PhD supervisor, while not a bad person, is a bad mentor and has given me bad advice in the past. So discussing this with him isn't really productive. I have talked to other people in real life about this, and the opinion of this community would also be welcome.\n\nI'm set to finish my PhD in theoretical physics in September 2020. I applied to several postdocs, got three interviews, and in one I was rated among the top choices but, in the end, I didn't secure any position.\n\nI don't know how similar this is to the fields, but for context I'll explain how postdoc appointments work in (edit: high energy) theoretical physics. In my field, postdoc applications run in cycles. The majority have roughly the same application periods and deadlines (around November), most offers are made at the same time (early January following year) and they all start roughly at the same time (September). There's the occasional outlier, but that's the basic pattern. This means that it's more or less hopeless that I can continue looking for a position, ask professors, etc, for September 2020. If I wanted to stay in academia, I would need to look for a postdoc in the next cycle, starting September 2021.\n\nI am unsure how realistic it is for me to try again or if I should simply throw the towel and quit academia.\n\n\nFirst, there's the issue of staying one year academically idle (obviously not professionally idle, that would be insane). I could work on leftover projects from my PhD on my free time, but between finishing my PhD in September 2020 and the deadline for the next cycle on November 2020, that leaves very little time to do so. \nSecond, how do I even explain the gap in my cover letter? If I flat out say I failed the previous application cycle, it's a guaranteed trip to the garbage can. Some people have recommended me just lying in vague terms, like I didn't pursue a postdoc immediately after completing my PhD due to \"health concerns that have since been resolved\". I'm unsure if this is a good idea...\n\n\nIf anyone has any other advice regarding my situation besides these two concerns I've raised, that would be welcome too. Basically, I would like to stay in academia as a first preference, but I have no desire to bang my head against the wall against something that, at this point, might be very close to impossible. I don't have any preference for country to work in, so feel free to give country-specific advice.\n",

Having difficulty to get a postdoc is probably not your fault. There are many possible reasons, such as field not a good match, advisor not helpful, institution not a good match. However, it is not clear that the situation will be different next year. \n\n2) In the past it has been quite uncommon for people to work in the private sector and then return to academia. If it is just a year then you can probably finish another paper or two from your graduate work, and describe your stint as gaining real world experience. I don't think it is true that people will just discard your application, but it does not improve it, either. \n\n3) The good news is that suddenly there does appear to be a new track. If you are interested in machine learning or quantum information then you can try to get a private sector job in this area, and that does leave open the possibility of returning to academia after you have gained some experience (after two years, for example, or even later than that).\n",

    "wrong_answer": "You should note that the word \"editor\" is used in many ways for quite different things. Most people understand it to mean \"someone who makes changes/edits to the text\". But that isn't how it is necessarily used. While the publishing industry does, in fact, employ people who do that, working with an author to improve the text, it usually means someone with some management responsibility. \n\nIn the case of your paper, I suspect that a \"managing editor\" (a manager) has assigned your paper to a lower level \"subject editor\" (or some similar term) whose main responsibility is to track the progress of the paper through the system. He or she will find reviewers, track their progress, and collect reviews. When all reviews are in, that \"editor\" will make a recommendation to some higher level \"editor\" about whether to accept or not. If the overall decision is to accept, then your subject editor may assign someone to work with the author on improving the text - a traditional editor. \n\nI used the term \"subject editor\", not because it is a term of use, but because it describes someone who actually knows a bit about the subject of the paper and which reviewers would be good for getting advice. This is most likely the \"editor\" that the system is referring to. It means, roughly, \"we are handling it and progress is being made\". \n\nSee the Scholarly Books... section of this wikipedia article for the typical usages. \"Project editor\" = \"subject editor\". \n",

    "title": "Avoiding \"Zoom bombing\" in virtual conferences and seminars",
    "question": "With travel restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic, many academics are organizing online seminars and conferences as a substitute for regular in-person university seminars, colloquia, and research conferences.  \n\nIn real life, seminars are usually open to anyone who wants to drop in, and every attendee can be seen and heard and may ask questions.  So an obvious approach is to organize the event using video meeting software such as Zoom, and simply post the link on a public website so that any interested person can participate.  However, this also opens the event to \"Zoom bombers\", random people who just want to disrupt the proceedings with annoying or offensive video / audio / text chat - such abuse has unfortunately become very common in public Zoom meetings.\n\nWhat best practices exist to keep such an event as open as possible to legitimate participants, and let them interact with each other and the speaker in a reasonable way, while reducing the risk of disruption and abuse?\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of these strategies?\n\nStrategies could be general, or involve specific features of certain software.\n\nSome strategies I've thought of, and their drawbacks:\n\n\nCreate a password for the meeting.  Then the question is, to whom should the organizer give the password?  If they only give it to people they know, it excludes people who might be interested but whom they happen not to know.  If they distribute it to large mailing lists of interested academics, it raises the chance that it will fall into the wrong hands.\nOffer to share the password by email upon request.  This requires extra time from the organizer to respond to those emails, and to manually verify the credentials of each requester.\nRequire a nominal registration fee, as real-life conferences often do.  This requires setting up an online payment system, which can be a lot of work, and may exclude people who are only casually interested, or who don't have funding, or who work in less wealthy parts of the world.  It may also involve the organizer in a lot of bureaucracy with their university as to how the fees will be managed and spent.\nUse a \"waiting room\" feature, where participants must be approved immediately before joining.  However, as far as I know, the host only sees the participant's name.  If they see an unfamiliar name, how can they tell whether it is a troll, or a legitimate researcher whom they just happen not to know?  Conversely, I don't think there is anything to stop a troll from masquerading under the name of a famous academic.\n\n\nI am wondering if people have thought of better solutions, that are specifically appropriate to academia.  Such strategies might take advantage of specific features of the academic community, e.g. to authenticate genuine researchers (.edu addresses? accounts on preprint servers? ORCid IDs?).  Answers could also address the pros and cons of such strategies as they apply to academia in particular, and how well they fit with people's existing expectations for academic conferences.\n",

Moreover there are some serious security and privacy concerns about Zoom (see e.g. this statement by the FBI and this investigation by the NY attorney general; Bruce Schneier has written an overview of the concerns here).\n\nIn our department we use BigBlueButton (website, Wikipedia) for our classrooms and seminars. It's a completely open-source and free web conferencing system. There are a few services out there that host servers but they're completely overloaded at the moment. I'd say your best bet would be to get your IT services to host a server for your department. With BBB by default new users don't have their webcams activated, and you can prevent them from doing so. You can even prevent them from using their microphone and require them to virtually \"raise their hand\" before a moderator allows them to speak. That should cut down a lot of the abuse. You can also set up the service so that an account is required before accessing the meeting. Unless the abuser is very dedicated, they probably won't bother creating dozens of accounts to continue bothering people after being kicked out, I hope.\n\nAlso, something obvious: many abusers are specifically targeting Zoom and going into random Zoom meetings. Unless you've somehow attracted abusers who are specifically targeting you, if you use something else (especially something hosted by your own department), you probably won't have any problems.\n\nNote: I'm only recommending BBB because that's what we use at our department, but there are other services out there. I know another department has set up something called \"Panopto\" for example, and another something called \"Classilio\" - you'll have to look that up, I don't know much about it.

    "question": "I was flying from Canada back home, after all the in-person classes and tests were canceled.\nSo my country(Kazakhstan) has strict laws that were enforced in regard of the new pandemic. They include closing a passenger of an international flight coming in to Kazakhstan in a quarantine hospital.\nIn my case there was only 1 city that had a working airport in the country, my only resort was going there and later traveling to my city.\nThe whole process took place in a prisoner-like environment in which i was held for 4 days. By my release from the first city, i was already late on one of my assignments, and by the time I actually got home in my city, but without luggage and got back to relatively normal state, i was late on the second one.\nMy question is, should I be contacting my professor about this messed up situation, or should i consider something else. Im asking this because the missed assignments could make me fail the course.\n",

    "question": "A few years ago we wanted to open a new program that will be based on distance learning,  however, getting accredited for having a master degree program that is based on distance learning and not on campus is literally a bureaucratic nightmare.\nFirst, no one allowed us to use Zoom, Microsoft Teams or other currently popular distance learning tools, second it should be some sort of  \"Moodle\" program with clear guidelines for each week. Third everything needs to be under guidelines of the Distance Education Accrediting Commission, in current COVID19 teaching organizational crisis we don't follow those guidelines at all.\nI wonder what are legal repercussions for doing distance learning when you are not accredited to do one. Can our students with disability complain since when they needed this option we couldn't provide to them since our excuse was that we weren't ready or accredited to do so? And last but not least, can we legally organize accredited on-campus program but perform it online or using distance learning completely?\n",
    "answer_id": "147468",
    "answer": "Edit: this answer is somewhat specific to the context of the COVID-19 health crisis and about legal justifications for various exceptional teaching strategies being adopted by many universities all over the world these days. It’s not clear if that’s what you meant to ask about exactly. If it’s not, please clarify.\n\n\n\nThe COVID-19 situation and the way universities are responding to it is an illustration of the adage that “it is easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission”. Basically the situation is so unprecedented that universities are doing whatever they can to stay operational, and leaving legal questions for later. My guess is that these will all be addressed by governments, legislatures, and regulatory bodies at a later time when the people in charge emerge out of panic mode and have time for dealing with such issues.\n\nAt the same time, the question of legality is indeed significant, and people are in fact paying attention. For example, in the US, I have heard that the visas of many foreign students explicitly forbid “online learning”. As a result, I have also heard (this is basically gossip and I can’t confirm it or cite a reference) that some institutions are referring to their current mode of operation as “remote learning” in a euphemistic attempt to pretend that that’s conceptually different from “online learning”. Silly? Perhaps, but that’s the kind of advice lawyers are giving apparently. Similar fig-leaf, CYA-style advice is being given about protecting your Zoom class meeting with a password to avoid being accused of compromising your students’ privacy. Does that mean using Zoom is technically legal in the sense of being fully FERPA-compliant? Who knows - probably not. But at least we make an effort to minimize whatever legal issues we have time to think about and energy to do something about.\n\nBut the short answer is, in the academic context as well as other contexts having to do with civil liberties, restrictions on people’s movements and many other aspects of our daily lives that are being disrupted, the law is lagging far behind. People in charge will do whatever they need to do without asking for permission, and ask for forgiveness later if they have to (they probably won’t).\n",

    "wrong_answer": "Perhaps the bureaucratic jungle can be skirted: Offer an on-campus program, deliver material digitally, and make a room available for screenings of that material. Deliver office hours, tutorials, etc. digitally too, allowing students to be in the room, should they choose. You are offering an on-campus program. You're also doing an excellent job of catering for students that can't make class, e.g., they're sick, their kid is sick, their car broke down, ... As it turns out, your program is also excellent for distance learning. \n\nPerhaps you'd fall foul under inspection, then you're reliant on begging for forgiveness, as Dan mentioned. Get your head of department on-board, get a legal opinion.\n\n\n  can we legally organize accredited on-campus program but perform it online or using distance learning completely?\n\n\nThat's a legal question, INAL, but perhaps an accredited on-campus program can be delivered without any students present... And, if that happens, it'd make economic sense to drop the screening room, students can use existing computer facilities (typically paid from someone else's budget).\n",

That is however typically only the case in my area when you work with them as an assistant, are doing a thesis with them or have a very small specialist class. If you only know him from hearing a lecture of 50+ students, it might well appear that you consider your relationship more personal than it is, i.e. are slightly violating social norms. However, this should normally just be taken as an oddity. So if you err in that direction it's no big deal, but it's also no issue if you don't send a mail in basically all cases that fit the question. So you can relatively safely do what feels right to you.\n\nAs a guideline, the more you already know about him beyond his professional capacity, the more likely it will be seen as appropriate. And the more your relationship so far has been distanced and purely professional the more likely it may come of as odd. A simple check is also to consider how many other students would be at the same level of closeness. When you announce something like this, a handful of mails from people that you know is sweet. Five hundred mails from five hundred peoples whose names you don't know unless you look into your student register is more a (still well meant) nuisance than a help to most people.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "The quick answer: it is not so much that part of your death star gets sliced away as that the death star as a whole will have an extremely hard time escaping even with maximum thrust, and the part below the horizon definitely will not escape. Either the ship tears itself apart or falls in.\n\nLong answer: you approach the black hole along what normally would be a hyperbolic flyby trajectory. Sitting in the control room you do not experience any force, since you are in free-fall along a geodesic curve. \n\nBut as you get closer the structure starts to creak: different parts of the death star are at different distance from the black hole and subjected to different spacetime curvature. This produces tidal forces that try to pull and squeeze the spherical death star into an ellipsoid pointed at the black hole. You are however smug, since you choose a supermassive black hole and hence the tidal forces are not that severe, even at the horizon. Had you used a non-spherical spacecraft there would also had been a torque trying to rotate you, but again, death stars for the win.\n\nNow you get very close to the event horizon, skimming it. The view outside looks decidedly weird (since you are inside the photon sphere and having relativistic aberration). At this point trouble appears: your free-fall trajectory does not continue back out to infinity, but spirals into the black hole! Unlike in Newtonian gravity close free-fall trajectories do not return out. The reason is that you are inside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). The only trajectories in this region that do not end up in the black hole are sufficiently steeply outgoing ones.\n\nSo you turn on your super-thrusters and try to break free by increasing your velocity in the right direction. But now you have a problem: the part of the death star furthest from the black hole needs merely a lot of extra velocity to be on a trajectory that leaves the hole region. The innermost part needs to move faster than light to break free. So if you can achieve some maximum boost there are going to be parts that, had they not been connected to the superstructure but freely flying, would not escape. So your boost turns into stress across the death star. Something has to give, and no matter what boost you are giving the innermost parts through the engines and pulling metal they will not move outward since they are below the horizon.\n\nIt is at this point I strongly recommend running to the escape pods. \n\nExactly what the fate of the death star will be depends on a lot of things, but the simplest case is that the overall boost is insufficient and it all falls in. It might also break apart. Relativity shows that there are no perfectly rigid materials (they would need to have a speed of sound faster than light), so not even an imaginary death star will avoid getting pulled apart. \n\nIn the end, I leave you to explain your little joyride to the Emperor. \n\n[It is worth noting that nothing looks strange locally when you cross an event horizon. It is a global property of spacetime, not something you can directly see. Extended objects crossing it merely have some parts whose future trajectories will meet the singularity, and the parts just outside may meet the singularity, but can escape if they break away somehow.]\n",

    "question": "I was thinking about this problem when I searched up how warm it takes to kill the new coronavirus. A source said 132 fahrenheit for 30 minutes. I wanted to calculate how much energy that would take so then I could easily find out how long I would have to microwave an object to get the same results.\n\nAll I want is just how much energy is put into maintaining this 132 fahrenheit for half an hour at a room temperature.

    "answer_id": "541156",
    "answer": "The amount of energy required to maintain water at some temperature over some time is simply equal to the amount of energy that the water loses to the environment over that time.\n\nIt depends on the conditions that the water is in, specifically how much heat the water is losing the environment. For example, it will take more energy to maintain water at 132 F when you place it in a cold windy environment because it's losing lots of heat in that environment.\n\nSo let's say you have a simple scenario of a pot of water sitting in room temperature. A simple energy balance on your water gives:\n\n$$ q_{in} = hA_s(T-T_0) $$\n\nWhere $q_{in}$ is the input power, $h$ is an effective heat transfer coefficient telling how much heat the water loses to the ambient (typical value of 5-10 $W/m^2K$ for a 56 C object sitting in a room with no wind), $A_s$ is the surface area of your water container, $T$ is the temperature of the water (56 C), and $T_0$ is room temperature (25 C).\n\nSo, all you need is the surface area of your water container. Then solve for the required power $q_in$, and multiply by time (30 min) to get the required energy.\n\n$$ Q_{in} = tq_{in} $$ \n\nWhere $t$ is the time you desire (30 min).

    "title": "In the Feynman Path Integral, why must \"contributing paths\" be continuous? Or is this a false notion?",
    "question": "I have been studying the Feynman path integral and its various derivations, and I've run into a bit of a problem. The standard Feynman path integral appears as follows:\n$$\n\\int \\mathcal{D}[x(t)]\\exp\\left(\\frac i \\hbar \\int_0^t d\\tau\\ \\left( \\frac m2 \\dot{x}(\\tau) - V(x(\\tau) \\right) \\right)\n$$\nWhere the path integral is defined by passing the following into the continuum limit:\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\\idotsint d^{n-1}x\\ \\mathcal{N} \\exp\\left( \\frac i \\hbar \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left( \\frac m2 \\left( \\frac{x_{j+1} - x_j}{\\Delta t} \\right)^2 - V(x_j) \\right) \\Delta t \\right)\n$$ \nwhere $\\Delta t = t/n$. In this form, we independently integrate each $x_j$ from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$, and hence there is no innate notion that the paths considered must be continuous; $x_{j+1}$ and $x_j$ can be as far apart as we please. \n\nIn doing readings, I have found multiple sources that claim that the paths we consider are continuous, for example in this paper. In transforming to imaginary time ($-t \\to -i\\tau$), this claim makes sense, since discontinuities in the path will blow up the the sum and they will be exponentially suppressed. However, in the form presented above, I am not quite sure where and how we can make this claim.\n\nI have seen the argument that paths that deviate greatly from the classical path will lead to extreme oscillatory behavior from our phase, and hence will be suppressed since they will on-average integrate to zero. However, I don't think I am satisfied with this argument to claim we must have continuity. This shows which paths contribute the most, but I don't think it rules out discontinuous paths. Does anyone have insight into this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n",

    "answer": "The paths of a Feynman integral do not always have to be continuous, and the first example that comes to my mind is the Feynman integral in the Feynman-Vernon formalism, which is used to study the spin-boson model, among other things.\n\nFor the spin-boson problem, the $x(t)$ paths written in your question, are discontinuous. If the spin in your spin-boson problem is a spin-1/2 particle, then $x(t)$ will be either -1/2 or +1/2 at each time $t$, and the Feynman integral will be over all possible paths, of which I'll give four examples below: \n\n\n$x(t)$ = -1/2 for all $t$.\n$x(t)$ = +1/2 for all $t$.\n$x(t)$ = -1/2 from $t=0$ to $t$=5ps, and $x(t)$=+1/2 for the rest of the time.\n$x(t)$ = -1/2 from $t=0$ to $t$=5ps, $x(t)$=+1/2 from $t$=5ps to $t$=10ps, then $x(t)$=-1/2 for the rest of the time.\n\n\nIf you allow all possible flips between spin-up and spin-down between $t=0$ and the rest of your desired time for the Feynman integral, there will be an infinite number of such paths. \n\nThe software FeynDyn (Feynman Dynamics) can calculation such Feynman integrals for up to 16 spin-1/2 particles (or 16 qubits, if simulating a quantum computer in the presence of noise) and more information about this whole \"Feynman-Vernon\" formalism can be found in this paper (I have given a free link to the PDF rather than the original journal, in case COVID lockdown has caused you not to be on a campus where you can download papers easily). \n",

    "answer_id": "538809",
    "answer": "It's a nice idea. Sadly it won't work but there is still some interesting physics involved.\n\nAs a general rule resonance is only an efficient way to transfer energy to an object if that object has a high Q factor. A high Q factor means the energy supplied builds up and increases the amplitude of the oscillation, and this may get large enough to damage the object. This is the (alleged) mechanism for the shattering of wine glasses by overenthusiastic sopranos. Wine glasses have a high Q and you can tell this by the way they ring for a while when you tap them. As a contrast, potatoes have a low Q and do not ring when you tap them. So our sopranos would have a hard time shattering a potato.\n\nThe problem with using ultrasound to kill cells or viruses is that in general they are squishy low Q objects like potatoes, not high Q objects like wine glasses, and they do not store the energy of the sound efficiently enough for the amplitude of oscillation to build up to destructive levels. So the technique simply won't work.\n\nUltrasound is used to kill tumours, but this does not work by resonance - the energy in the sound simply heats the cancer tissue and kills it. It is used for tumours because the sound can be focused onto the tumour where it causes local heating. This would not work for viral infections since the virus is distributed throughout the body not concentrated in one area onto which the sound can be targeted.\n\nEven if viruses were brittle like glass it would still be hard to make them resonate enough to be damaged when they are in a fluid like water. There are two reasons for this.\n\nFirstly water is much denser and much more viscous than air so it efficiently damps the vibrations of any objects moving in it. For example if you tap a glass underwater it will not ring as it does in air. So even objects that have a high Q factor in air will have a drastically lower Q factor in water. This applies to viruses in humans since as far as sound waves are concerned human tissue is little different from water.\n\nSecondly sound waves are a compression wave and they propagate by alternately compressing and expanding the water. The amount the water compresses and stretches is determined by the bulk modulus and this is relatively high. That means the amplitude of the wave is small unless the energy is very high, and consequently the mechanical deformation of objects in the water by the wave is small. This makes it hard to deform the virus enough to damage it.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "Yes, I think $1\\,\\mathrm{lx}$ is indeed absurdly low for a flashgun of any reasonable capacity.\n\nA very brief intuitive argument as to why this is is that the flashes from flashguns last for under $1/1000\\,\\mathrm{s}$ and yet, distances of the order of $1\\,\\mathrm{m}$, they can light scenes brightly enough in that time to be equivalent to an exposure of $1/100\\,\\mathrm{s}$ of the same scene in full sunlight.\n\n\n\nBelow I have tried to put a numerical value on how bright a flash must be for a particular (non-exceptional) model.  I suspect that this contains errors, but it bears out the intuitive argument above.\n\nAlthough I don't know how bright cellphone flashes are, it's possible to work out how bright camera flashes are since they publish enough information.  As an example, I took the Pentax F-360 FGZ II flashgun (manual: this was just the first I found in a page of flashes and it looks like a non-stupidly-powerful one: I presume it is brighter than cellphone flashes).  This has a 'guide number' of $36$ (in metres, at ISO $100$: see below), and at full brightness it lights for $1/1200\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe first thing to sort out is how large an area the flash illuminates at a given distance, $d$.  I will assume that it covers enough area for a $50\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ lens on $35\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ film with a fudge factor of $2$ (so, twice the area).  Such a lens has an angle of view, $\\alpha \\approx \\pi/8$ (45 degrees in old money).  So assuming a standard $3/2$ film frame, I get that the area covered, $A$ is\n\n$$\nA = 2 \\times \\frac{24}{13}\\left(d\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\right)^2\n$$\n\nWhere the  $24/13$ comes from fitting a film frame into the image circle of the lens, and the $2$ is the fudge factor (the flash covers some rectangle which is going to be significantly bigger than the film frame or there will be vignetting), which is probably really quite a lot larger than $2$.  And I may have made mistakes in this but it's good enough.\n\nSo now, rather than think about lumens or lux which will require knowing the albedo of whatever the camera is looking at, I will work out how bright the flash must be compared to full sunlight.  This is helped by knowing the famous sunny 16 rule, known to all photographers of a certain age:\n\n\n  in full sunlight, you get reasonable exposures with a film of ISO speed $S$ by exposing for $1/S\\,\\mathrm{s}$ at $f/16$.\n\n\nAnd now we come to the nightmare of flash guide numbers, which are not numbers but quantities with dimensions.  The basic definition of a guide number, for a given film (or sensor) speed $S$ is that\n\n$$\nG_S = \\frac{d}{a}\n$$\n\nwhere $a$ is the aperture of the lens.  $a$ is dimensionless (it's the ratio between the focal length and the effective diameter of the lens), so the units of $G_S$ are length.  This definition works because the light that gets into the lens goes as the square of the aperture $a$, and the amount of illumination falls of as the square of distance $d$.  And really I should factor in $S$ here but I've just defined $G$ at a given speed, $S$.\n\nSo for the flash referenced at the top of this answer, we know that $G_{100} = 36\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and since we're interested in $f/16$ because we know the sunny 16 rule, we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nd &amp;= \\frac{G_{100}}{16}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\\\\n  &amp;= \\frac{36}{16}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\\\\n  &amp;= \\frac{9}{4}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn other words, as $f/16$ &amp; using ISO $100$ film, this flash will light something a bit over $2\\,\\mathrm{m}$ away.\n\nBut it does this in $1/1200\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and in fact I will add another fudge factor of $2$ here, because the flash isn't a perfect top-hat function, it will ramp up and down.  So I'll assume that it does it in $1/2400\\,\\mathrm{s}$.  In other words, at this distance, it lighting the scene $24$ times more brightly than the Sun, because the Sun takes $1/100\\,\\mathrm{s}$ to do the same thing.\n\nAnd finally we can work out the area it must illuminate from above: we now know that $d = 9/4\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and $\\alpha = \\pi/8$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA &amp;= 2 \\times \\frac{24}{13}\\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{16}\\right)\\right)^2\\\\\n  &amp;\\approx 0.74\\,\\mathrm{m^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo based on the lux table here, full sunlight might be $50\\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{lx}$, so this flashgun must be putting about $1200\\times 10^2\\,\\mathrm{lx}$ into an area of about $0.74\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$.\n\nI'm kind of uncomfortable with this working, because I'm unwilling to believe flashguns are that bright (note there are two fudge factors here which could reduce things by a factor of $4$ though).  But I think it is very clear that, yes, $1\\,\\mathrm{lx}$ is absurdly low as the brightness of a flashgun.\n",

I have been several times to 7/11, boots, Watson, and other pharmacies, and everytime they did not have it as they ran out. How is it possible that the producers of masks give up on additional earning by not producing more masks, now that it's pretty obvious the demand is going up?\n\nThe fact that there are not enough masks is my personal experience in Bangkok - however, some friends of mine have the same experience in Italy, where the Corona Virus outbreak has reached a scary stage.\n\nGenerally.

    "answer": "This is a common problem in many domains. For example, there's massive new demand of Airbus planes after the Boeing 737 Max 8 disaster, and their manufacturing capacity is maxed out.\n\nI'm familiar with it from the domain of software development, so I'll use that as an example.\n\nSuppose some website gets mentioned on Reddit and the post happens to hit the first page. It gets the \"Reddit hug of death\" (the swarm of reddit users overwhelm the website's servers, and it becomes unavailable). You could ask the same question:\n\n\n  How is it possible that the producers of [this site] give up on additional earning by not [spinning up more servers], now that it's pretty obvious the demand is going up?\n\n\nIf that \"additional earning\" (of having more of your product available to provide) is less than it costs to permanently over-provision a resource (web servers, mask production factories, etc.), then it's not economical to do so.\n\nCloud infrastructure is becoming incredibly liquid, because resources are very flexible and can be pooled. A high traffic day for my website might be a low traffic day for yours. A cloud provider could scale down your site (saving you money) by uninstalling your software from a server, reassigning that server to me, and use it to scale up my site by installing my software on it (raising my infrastructure costs, but also raising my business' income because it hasn't gone down). There are even auto-scaling systems that can scale your service up and down in response to current load. There's still some lead time, on the order of a few minutes for web server virtual machines.\n\nThe real world is much less flexible than software. If masks are in hot demand, but construction helmets aren't, you can't re-purpose the injection molds for hard hats into face-mask stitching machines. There are many factors involved in deciding whether or not its worth in investing to grow the mask manufacturing business:\n\n\nHow many masks are available in reserve? In the warehouses of factories and distributors, in hospitals, in military bases, etc.\nHow long do we think this epidemic will last? Will it last long enough to deplete the reserves? Is it long-term enough to justify the high up front expenses?\nHow much marginal profit is there to be made in selling these extra masks?\n\n\nInterestingly, this problem repeats itself and plays itself out upstream in the supply chain. Are the companies that make mask-stitching machines able to produce enough for the new demand? What about their upstream supply chain?\n",

I rectified typos, and simplified some  names and numbers. \n\n\nWon't Cal demand  his principal back at some time in the future? \nSimilarly, won't countries' sovereign debts demand their principal? \nFor example, China holds much US treasuries and US sovereign debt. If China thinks COVID-2019 will cripple the US and wants to park its money else where, won't China demand all of its principal from the US so that it can buy Australia or New Zealand sovereign debt instead? \n\n\n\n  'Country A owes \\$10  to country B, and has agreed to pay 2% interest annually. Call this Debt X.\n  \n  Country B owes \\$15  to country A, and has agreed to pay 1% interest annually. This is Debt Y.\n  \n  Investor A is willing to purchase Debt X for \\$12, because he values the steady rate of return, and believes country A is very likely to pay its debts. He isn't as sure about Debt Y, but he is willing to pay \\$16 for it. Investor B thinks that investor A is going to change his mind about Debt Y and value it more highly, so he is willing to pay \\$17 for it today.\n  \n  Debt is traded constantly and it's valued differently. Just because 2 countries owe each other similar amounts of money, doesn't mean the value cancels out in any meaningful way.\n  \n  Think of debt this way. You and your three brothers all own a house together. Each year you take up a collection of \\$1000 a head for \\$~4k annual upkeep on the house. One year, a tree falls on the roof, and the house needs another \\$4000 bucks. Everyone could just chip in 1k each, but one brother is having a tough year, so instead, you loan the house \\$4k, with the expectation that it will pay you 1% interest a year.\n  \n  Your brothers agree, and over the years, this comes up a few more times. You even use debt to finance installing a new hottub. You now own \\$20k in debt from the house, 1 brother owns \\$5k, and for some weird reason, your neighbor Cal wants to purchase the debt from you. (He really thinks your household is trustworthy, and wants somewhere to park \\$20k for 1% interest).\n  \n  Now C owns \\$20k of debt from your house, so C owns 80% of all your house's debt. Would you say C owns your house now? Well of course not, your house is likely worth many times more what C has claim to. If someone in your house is super worried about the situation, they could take up a collection in the house to buy the debt back from C, but it's not a popular idea, because most people can think of better things to do with their money than pay off C so they don't have to make the small yearly interest payments.\n\n",

    "answer": "\nThe principal has to be repaid eventually but with majority of formal debt instruments such as government bonds the creditor can’t just demand repayment whenever he or she wants. Most debt instruments have pre-specified date and if not date then conditions when and how the principal is being paid back.\n\n\nFor example a standard 10year bond will pay its principal in 10 years not a day earlier (unless you actually manage to convince the debtor to voluntary agree to pay it sooner).\n\n\nThe above works for sovereign countries too. A 10 year government bond will have on it printed that principal is payed back exactly after 10years. \n\n\nNow this is outside economics, but technically sovereign nations are in state of anarchy so I can imagine one country could just decide to say to another pay now or we will invade you/nuke you etc. but aside of some military intervention there is no way of legally forcing the country to pay.\n\nIn fact any government can, in principle, default on its debts anytime it wants. The only constraint on sovereign default is that if you constantly default on your debt nobody will want to lend you money in the future, or if only at punitively high interest. Hence on sovereign level governments as debtors have much better bargaining power than just individuals.\n\nGovernment can be forced to pay its debt only through military action, or in some cases by diplomatic pressure (for example EU could threaten Greece by revoking its euro-zone or EU membership, US could threaten countries by economic sanctions etc.). Aside from that there is nothing other country can do to get its money back if debtor nation says no.\n\n\nBased on 1, and 2 you probably already know the answer. No that’s not possible. China could patiently wait for bonds to expire and then not buy new US bonds but instead buy Australian or New Zeeland bonds. Of course, since there is a lot of debt being issued by US government probably every month there are bonds expiring and being replaced by new ones so China could start do it sooner than later.\n\n\nAlso beside of that, usually when people want to get rid of a debt they won’t wait for maturity and for repayment of the principal. They will take the bond to bond market and sell it at market price to get money now. That creates a trouble for country in a sense that now it has to set lower price or higher interest on its newly issued bonds due to increased supply, but whether this becomes a problem depends on plethora of factors many unrelated to the original debtor and creditor countries, such as how big is the demand for the debtors bonds etc.\n",

    "answer": "With the right keywords (and author searches) from earlier papers, I actually found some academic output already; this might not be peer-reviewed yet, i.e. preprints:\n\n\nMcKibbin and Fernando (2 March 2020) The Global Macroeconomic Impacts of COVID-19: Seven Scenarios\n\n\n  examines the impacts of different scenarios on macroeconomic outcomes and\n  financial markets in a global hybrid DSGE/CGE general equilibrium model.\n  The scenarios in this paper demonstrate that even a contained outbreak could significantly\n  impact the global economy in the short run. [...]\n  These results are very sensitive to the assumptions in the model, to the shocks we feed in and\n  to the assumed macroeconomic policy responses in each country.\n\nAnd that's already cited by Wang et al. COVID-19's Impact on China's Economy Based on Data of Spring Festival Travel Rush\n\n\n  this paper starts with the analysis of the daily railway passenger volume data during the Spring Festival travel rush, and establishes three time series to model the railway passenger volume, GDP in the first quarter model, and GDP in the last three quarters respectively. The forecast results indicate that: (a) Affected by the epidemic, China’s economy will lose 4.8 trillion yuan in the first quarter of 2020, which is an expected decrease of 20.69% and a year-on-year drop of 15.60%; (b) China's expected GDP growth rate for the full year of 2020 will reduce from 6.50% to 1.72%. However, there are some positive factors not taken into account in these models, which means that the forecast results may be underestimated. With the global spread of the epidemic, the instability of the world economy will in turn impact China’s economy.\n\nA more recent (March 30) paper, Greenstone and Nigam that emphasizes/quantifies the benefits of the lockdowns, in the US:\n\n\n  Using the Ferguson et al. (2020) simulation model of COVID-19’s spread and mortality impacts in the United States, we project that 3-4 months of moderate distancing beginning in late March 2020 would save 1.7 million lives by October 1. Of the lives saved, 630,000 are due to avoided overwhelming of hospital intensive care units. Using the projected age-specific reductions in death and age-varying estimates of the United States Government’s value of a statistical life, we find that the mortality benefits of social distancing are about \\$8 trillion or $60,000 per US household. Roughly 90% of the monetized benefits are projected to accrue to people age 50 or older. Overall, the analysis suggests that social distancing initiatives and policies in response to the COVID-19 epidemic have substantial economic benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\nJP Morgan has put out some estimates already, although they don't detail their methodology as much as a peer-reviewed publication would (have to).\n\n\n  The U.S. economy is projected to contract by 14% in the second quarter, after experiencing a 4% contraction in the first quarter, before recovering to 8% and 4% growth in the third and fourth quarters. Euro area GDP will suffer an even deeper contraction, with double-digit declines of 15% and 22% in the first and second quarters, before rebounding by 45% and 3.5% in the third and fourth quarters.\n  \n  “There is no longer doubt that the longest global expansion on record will end this quarter. We now think that the COVID-19 shock will produce a global recession, as nearly all of the world contracts over the three months between February and April,” said Bruce Kasman, Chief Economist at J.P. Morgan. Initially, the expectation was the novel-recession may generate limited labor market damage, but J.P. Morgan Research is now forecasting the unemployment rate for developed markets as a whole will rise 1.6 percentage points in the next two quarters.\n  \n  “The rise in unemployment will be sharper in the U.S. than in the Euro area. Most immediately, U.S. initial jobless claims should spike above 400,000 in the coming weeks,” said Michael Feroli, Chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan.\n\n\nMcKinsey has a somewhat spread-out (March 25) presentation, but a couple of slides with their scenarios/estimates I could fish from there:\n\n\n\n\nLikewise, PWC has a March [white]paper mostly focused on Australia... but which does come with a global map attached of their estimates of GDP losses, alas in absolute figures only (and I think over one year based on what they say on the previous slide):\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a niche academic domain of estimating the economic impact of pandemics already, typically using a CGE model. Results depend of course on the assumptions used. E.g. Smith, Keogh-Brown et al. had a series of papers approximately a decade ago. Quoting from a later one that covered more than one European country:\n\n\n  Results suggest GDP losses from the disease of approximately 0.5–2% but school closure and prophylactic absenteeism more than triples these effects.\n\n\nSo they went as high ~10% GDP losses. While they did not envisage government mandated lockdown(s), they modelled \"prophylactic absenteeism\" in response to ~3% death rate media reports as the most severe case. An earlier paper of theirs, on UK only is open-access in the BMJ. Quoting their assumption from there\n\n\n  almost everybody in the population will know someone who has died once the mortality rate reaches one death per 300 people, triggering prophylactic absenteeism.\n\n\nThe same authors (Keogh-Brown and Smith) also published in 2008 a fairly detailed post-hoc account of how economic predictions for SARS fared in hindsight... which generally wasn't all that good, meaning that most models overestimated the economic impact of SARS. It cites positively an 2003 ADB paper of Fan that hedged its bets on two different scenarios (early containment being one of them).\n\nAnother paper Verikios et al. (2015) in a similar vein but attempts a global estimate (GTAP CGE), and also discussed prior/related work:\n\n\n  The two pandemic scenarios modelled give quantitatively and qualitatively different\n  results. [...] Our results show that the peak GDP effects on the world economy of an influenza pandemic are in the range 0.06 to 1.01 per cent in the peak year depending on the nature of the pandemic. Our results are smaller than the only previous estimates of the global economic effects of influenza pandemics by McKibbin and Sidorenko (2006). They estimate reductions in global GDP of between 0.8 and 12.6 per cent depending on the severity of the pandemic. Our results are not directly comparable to McKibbin and Sidorenko as they did not model a continuum of pandemic scenarios across the virulence-infectiousness continuum. Rather, they assume a given reproducibility of the virus (infectiousness) and vary virulence across their four scenarios. Further, they implicitly assume multiple waves for all their scenarios as they presume that\n  new infections continue to occur for greater than one year. This is likely to characterise only more extreme pandemics (such as the 1918–19 flu) rather than milder pandemics. Differences in the range of influenza pandemics modelled by us and McKibbin and Sidorenko are justifiable given the uncertain nature of future pandemics. Our results thus build upon the findings of McKibbin and Sidorenko by extending the estimation of potential GDP estimates over a further range of potential pandemic threat scenarios.\n  \n  [...] Our results show that the global macroeconomic effects of an influenza pandemic may be significant but are also likely to be short-lived. The largest economic impacts of an influenza pandemic are driven by reduced international tourism, due to risk-modifying measures by households and travel restrictions imposed by health authorities, and lost workdays, due to illness or formal social distancing measures designed to contain the virus. This is consistent with the work of Keogh-Brown et al. (2009, 2010). [...] \n\n\nVerikios seems to work for KPMG Australia nowadays and they have released a COVID-19 model that is fairly detailed in explaining its assumptions, for example it has separate pre- and post-stimulus arms/scenarios, but it mostly covers the Australian case, in particular only models the government response of that country.\n\nKPMG uses a NiGEM (New-Keynesian) macro model, and they've basically tweaked some parameters of this using estimates of shocks in four areas: reduction in productivity due to additional sick leave by workers, reduction in productivity due to additional carer’s leave by workers, incremental investment premium, capacity utilisation adjustment (i.e. supply chain disruptions). The first two were informed by fairly detailed labour &amp; health statistics, the latter two seem a bit more arbitrary to me, e.g. they added a flat 1% investment premium.\n\n\n\nI was hoping the IMF would have something more concrete than this, but I guess\nthey are weary of advancing anything more detailed yet:\n\n\n  The COVID-19 pandemic would cause a global recession in 2020 that could be worse than the one triggered by the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, but world economic output should recover in 2021, the IMF said on Monday.\n  \n  Georgieva issued the new outlook after a conference call of G20 finance ministers and central bankers, who she said agreed on the need for solidarity across the globe. [...]\n  \n  The outlook for global growth is negative and the IMF expects “a recession at least as bad as during the global financial crisis, or worse,” Georgieva said.\n  \n  Earlier this month, Georgieva had warned that 2020 world growth would be below last year’s 2.9 percent rate, but stopped short of predicting a recession.\n  \n  Georgieva on Monday said that a recovery is expected in 2021, but to reach it, countries would need to prioritize containment and strengthen health systems.\n  \n  “The economic impact is and will be severe, but the faster the virus stops, the quicker and stronger the recovery will be,” she said.\n\n\nThe CBO has now posted its own assessment for the US economy. It disclaims that it is \"highly uncertain, especially for later periods\", but basically, for the second quarter of 2020 it predicts 10 percent unemployment and the economy to contract by \"more than\" 7 percent.\n\nThe WTO Secretariat has posted this self-explanatory chart on April 8:\n\n\n",

    "answer": "Not by itself. The inflation generally depends on the following monetary relation:\n\n$$ MV =PY$$\n\nWhere M is money supply, V velocity of money (how much one buck is used in economy), P is the price level (change in which is inflation), and Y is a real output.\n\nNow solving for P so we can focus on inflation gives us:\n\n$$P=\\frac{MV}{Y}$$\n\nHence price level (and consequently) increases when money supply increases, velocity of money increases or output decreases.\n\nNow let’s analyze giving money to those unemployed.\n\n\nIs it newly created money? If not then money supply won’t increase. If yes then it would increase inflation rate.\nRedistribution generally does not affect velocity of money much so we can skip that.\nDoes this change the output Y? Well not by much those people are already unemployed. If anything it could increase Y as unemployed have probably high marginal propensity to consume so in short run redistribution from a richer person with lower marginal propensity to consume will increase Y. Especially if this spending was not paid out of higher taxes but from debt.\n\n\nSo a priori as long as it’s not financed through printing new money it should not really have effect on inflation. Inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon.\n\nAlso, yes it’s a redistribution mechanism like most of the things that UK government does. Any policy that uses government funds as a transfer to others, or fund non-public good services (like NHS for example) is a redistributive measure.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "It seems you are not confused about part (1) because that's exactly what it means.\n\nLexicographic preferences are monotone. Monotonicity means more is better. If I have more of every good in the bundle, then I like that bundle more. This is still true for lexicographic preferences, even though parts of the bundle may not matter. A condition for monotonicity is e.g. that (5,4) is preferred to (3,1). In other words if 5>3 and 4>1 then the first bundle is preferred. This is true for lexicographic preferences.\n\nYour definitions of strict monotonicity and lexicographic preferences seem to deviate a bit from conventional definitions though. Here is a proof using your definitions.\n\nProof:\n\nLet us compare two bundles with $n$ elements each: $x=(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ and $y=(y_1, y_2, ...,y_n)$\n\nIt is best to start with the if statement when going about proving such claims. The condition and therefore starting point is $x_1&gt;y_1$ and $x_2&gt;y_2$, .... , and $x_n&gt;y_n$.\n\nIn that case since  $x_1&gt;y_1$ we have according to your preference definition that bundle $x$ is preferred to bundle $y$. Furthermore we have that bundle $y$ is not preferred to bundle $x$. So bundle $x$ is strictly preferred.\n\nHence, we have shown that if $x_i$>$y_i$ for each $i$, then $x$ is preferred (because in that case $x_1 &gt; y_1$), which is your definition of monotonicity. The preferences are therefore monotonic.\n",

    "question": "Pls ELI5. 2013 was last time I opened macroeconomics textbook! I just have a B.A. economics.\n\nOn r/Economics, u/ComfortableCold9 asked\n\n\n  From your point of view, at what point would we [the USA in 2020] be approaching weimar? A QE program of 15 trillion? 25 trillion?\n\n\nRight under, u/Bumblewurth answered\n\n\n  From my point of view, never. What made hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic and (most other regimes with hyperinflation) was printing marks to pay debts in gold. The whole point of QE is to provide liquidity (already there) and to prevent deflation/meet inflation targets (not there yet.) If we're at QE with 25 trillion it's because we still haven't seen inflation in consumer prices.\n  \n  Inequality will be through the roof though as asset prices inflate.\n\n\nu/Bumblewurth answers u/ComfortableCold9's follow-ups quoted in line.\n\n\n  \n    [u/ComfortableCold9 :] So seeing as we pay our debts in dollar, that suggests to me that we are effectively reliant on the dollar maintaining its strength\n  \n  \n  [u/Bumblewurth :] No we aren't. If the dollar falls, the debts fall with the dollar. That's the difference between hyperinflationary economies in the past with non-sovereign debt and modern economies with sovereign debt. You aren't printing more dollars to chase the same amount of gold.\n  \n  \n    But as soon as we start to see a level of inflation that would warrant a massive QT program, the economy would be held hostage.\n  \n  \n  Economy is held hostage with deflation risk already. There's risk everywhere. That's life. But QE won't cause hyperinflation, just a whole lot of asset inflation and inequality.\n  \n  Most of this could be avoided if we weren't so tepid about using fiscal policy or if the fed had a fiscal tool to just send checks to everyone to manage deflation. Monetary policy is pushing on a string. But congress won't act, so here we are; Just like in 2008.\n\n\n\nLike u/ComfortableCold9 below, I too \"don't see a difference\"? \nI don't understand Bumblewurth's distinction between \"future obligations\" and \"current debts\". \"Current debts are wiped out when you monetize them\" — So what? \n\n\n\n  \n    [u/ComfortableCold9 :] I don't see a difference here; if the dollar started to lose lose strength, you would have to print more dollars to get the same value of what you're buying.\n  \n  \n  Yes, that's a concern for future obligations, not current debts. Current debts are wiped out when you monetize them. But once you get inflation you stop QE because the entire point of QE is to create inflation so that demand is at productive capacity. You aren't printing money to cover obligations and then printing ever more to cover the same obligations as your currency falls. You're printing more to prevent deflation. That's the point. QE and Weimar aren't related.\n\n",

    "answer": "If you want something \"even more ELI5\", try this from the Atlantic:\n\n\n  Let me unpack these one by one. Right now getting the markets to buy our debt isn't the problem. Getting enough debt for the markets to buy is the problem. Investors are so crazy to load up on Treasuries that they're actually paying us to borrow, taking inflation into account. But while we're currently getting free money from investors, Hungary circa 1945 was getting no money. It was an investment pariah. If Hungary wanted to rebuild its economy, its only recourse was the printing press.    \n  \n  Second, the United States isn't really printing money. At least not like post-war Hungary. Quantitative easing is usually described as \"money-printing\" but it's not really. QE involves the Fed buying longer-term bonds from banks. It simply swaps one asset for another -- in this case, cash for longer-term bonds. Unlike Hungary, the Fed isn't directly paying the Treasury's bills. This is a hugely important distinction.\n  \n  Whatever money the Fed \"prints\" is stuck in the banks. That money isn't inflationary as long as the banks don't lend it out. What if the banks do start lending at a faster clip? The Fed can still effectively pay the banks not lend by, for example, raising the interest on excess reserves or require the banks to set aside more money. It would be shocking for the Fed not to pursue one of these options.\n  \n  Third, the most important difference between us and post-war Hungary or Weimar is that our roads haven't been razed to the ground and half the country isn't striking. It's very difficult to have hyperinflation when you still have a functioning economy. Almost all examples of hyperinflation result from huge economic shocks that devastate an economy so much that leaders think printing money is the only solution to growth. As bad as the Great Recession has been, our GDP is already back to and above its all-time pre-recession high. As bad as unemployment is, more than 80 percent of the labor force is working. In Zimbabwe, 80 percent of the population was unemployed.\n  \n  Let's conclude with a modest proposal for an economic corollary to Godwin's Law. The first person to reference Weimar's hyperinflation in an economic debate automatically loses.\n\n\nYeah, it was written in 2012... Nowadays there are some fears (time will tell if justified) that people returning from the lockdowns [when those end] will cause \"unexpected\" inflation. But that's a different story, not really about QE.\n\nAnd if you want more recent data on where US inflation is headed, \"this just in\":\n\n\n  U.S. consumer prices fell by the most in more than five years in March and further decreases  are likely as the novel coronavirus outbreak suppresses demand for some goods and services, offsetting price increases related to shortages resulting from disruptions to the supply chain.\n  \n  The Labor Department said on Friday its consumer price index dropped 0.4% last month amid a tumble in the costs of gasoline, hotel accommodation, apparel and airline tickets. That was the biggest drop since January 2015 and followed a 0.1% gain in February. \n  \n  The general price level decline is expected even as the Federal Reserve has adopted extraordinary measures to stop the economy’s free-fall. [...]\n  \n  “The disinflationary impulse, along with the great disruption in economic and financial market activity, is a key reason why the Fed is unleashing vast new monetary policy stimulus,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

    "question": "On Apr 9 2020, the Fed for the First Time Can Buy Junk Bonds. That Should Help ‘Fallen Angels.’\n\n\n  The Federal Reserve is making its first-ever foray into the junk-rated corporate bond market, saying it will consider buying noninvestment-grade corporate bonds and exchange-traded funds.\n  \n  As part of an effort to make available \\$2.3 trillion in new loans amid the coronavirus crisis, the central bank said Thursday that it would buy the bonds of “fallen angel” companies, or companies that get downgraded from investment grade to junk. Companies will qualify if they had an investment-grade rating on March 22 and have since been downgraded to one of the top three tiers of the high-yield bond market (BB+, BB or BB-).\n\n\nBloomberg has a title \"Moral Hazard\".  Can't companies \"leverage themselves into oblivion and when they all [fail] the Fed will just buy their worthless bonds\"?\n\n\n  But the nature of the Fed’s actions pass the traditional boundaries of the central bank to purchase lower-rated debt and the credit of municipalities, raising questions about its future role.\n  \n  ”That does present some moral hazard but a lot will depend on how these programs are executed and how they’re unwound,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. “Are they executed in a way that doesn’t unduly benefit people? If the programs are devised effectively, hopefully that won’t be the case.”\n\n\nAre these Reddit comments below correct? I edited r/economics.\n\n\n  Let’s call it what it is, junk bonds. They don’t care about municipalities, this is buying up corporate garbage debt to bail out the rich. Corporate bonds was bad enough, junk bonds are straight garbage that WAS SUPPOSED TO BE RISKY so why is the Fed buying it. This is no benefit to Main St. at all. If your argument was the municipalities need to issue debt to function and this helps grease that market, the right answer is that municipalities that cannot clearly afford projects should not issue debt. Let’s be honest, boomers had so much money they threw it at high yield, enjoyed the gains but now it’s garbage so the taxpayer is bailing them out.\n  \n  This is the end of capitalism and free markets. You could argue that a few banks were too big to fail, maybe they should have. Now you are talking about 100’s of companies like Best Buy and Macy’s that we’re already doing bad so we are throwing cash at them in the form of loans and also bailing out their debt to people who shouldn't have bought it. Don’t forget how much these CEOs and boards make.\n  \n  I hate to be political but let’s remember T[ARP] actually made money, it was risky but the QE was limited in amount and by assets that were “good”. Look at the group of individuals in charge now and their financial history, the idea that the Fed will get its money back is an absolute joke.\n  \n  Junk bonds are junk because they are risky.\n  By definition they don't deserve to be saved by the government.\n  \n  Its purpose is to place cash on the balance sheets of organizations that invest in securities like junk bonds in the hopes that they will wake up and see credit risk and roll the cash into the stock market to bolster the President's re-election chances.\n  \n  [Source] Buying junk bonds is stupid - these shitty companies are all getting free money from the fed while at the same time laying off and furloughing millions of workers. Banks and other people with money then buy up ownership in these companies that won’t fail (arguably many should), benefiting from rising stock prices while the companies pay out no wages to workers. It’s all fake and will prop up the wealthy people who own businesses and leave the rest of America in line for food stamps. There is no reason for this insane rally in stock prices when upwards of 10 million Americans are unemployed.\n\n",

There's a few theoretical justifications for that statement, One is provided by Fiscal Theory of the Price Level (edge of mainstream), and another is referred to as \"neo-Chartalism\" (post-Keynesian).\n\nAs for the relationship between inflation and the rate of interest, the answer depends upon which school of economics you follow. Increasing interest rates increases the interest income of the private sector (which should increase effective demand, as you note), which is traded off by the effect on behaviour of the higher rate of interest. The conventional answer is that the behavioural effects dominate; that is, higher interest rates slow the economy and inflation.\n",

The point is many business have non-trivial fixed costs that have to be payed whether business operates or it doesn’t. Furthermore, in short run even some variable costs - like wages to employees on production line are fixed (and in many countries this can be up to several months). Hence, it’s not like a dormant business have no costs. \n\nYou might ask why then we don’t suspend for example these leases etc. but that just moves the problem to the different parties and does not eliminate this issue. \n\nMoreover, very large business might have enough financial cushion to absorb losses for few months, but there are many small-medium size business that can’t do that. For example, consider a sole trader (a form of business organization where one person embodies a business) who has a repair shop with no employees just living month to month. That kind of businessman can not afford to go on hiatus for very long.\n\nFurthermore, if by long you mean not just weeks but several months or even year that would be issue even for the best cushioned business.\n\nSo yes the impact could be catastrophic.

The timeframe for a vaccine is 12-18 months earliest. Then, the vaccine must be manufactured and distributed. Since the virus is so widespread that it is now assumed that it will reach a global critical mass, this essentially guarantees the collapse of the restaurant, airline, tourism, and hotel industries as they cannot sustain prolonged losses in a capitalistic structure. If they fail, their suppliers fail, and so on. History has shown that large systems are prone to failure time and time again, esp. when accountability is obfuscated (e.g. the Titanic, the World Wars/Holocaust, and now this). In the past Egypt fell, and then Rome fell. What is to say our current systems won’t fail, even if as a slowly sinking ship?\n\nEDIT: This question was closed, before I received enough good, thoughtful answers.

The economic effects of that scenario are very different than the scenarios presented by governments.

Things like dips and pull ups to strengthen the triceps and back. You can do core work because a stronger core is always a good thing. Pistol squats, while not the same as a loaded barbell squat, will allow you to keep training your legs.\n\nAlso, now is the perfect time to address all those little niggles and flexibility issues that you've been ignoring. That tight hip, the knee that aches if you keep it in the same position too long, the shoulder that's a little wonky, everything like that.\n\nFingers crossed, by fixing the little bits and throwing in some bodyweight stuff now, you'll be able to come back stronger (figuratively speaking) when you're able to get back to training.\n",

While you're at it, occasionally press the bag overhead, or carry it one side or the other, bear hug it to your chest, just play with the position to stress your muscles.\n\nIf you've only been training for a few weeks, chances are that you'll still gain strength from any sort of training, provided you don't slack off.

    "answer": "Getting someone into the habit of doing anything requires repetition, as that is what a habit is largely: a settled or regular tendency or practice.  \n\nThe best way to establish a habit in a child from my experience is to gently remind them to do the habitual action immediately after the \"cue\" for the action.  In this case, it would be to:\n\n\nHear your child cough\nIf they didn't cover: Remind them to cover their mouth\nPraise them for covering their mouth\n\n\nThe praise is appropriate either if they did cover their mouth, or if they didn't but they covered their mouth when you told them to (yes, this is pointless, but it establishes the habit).  \n\nThere are some more rigorous explanations of this method, such as here; that site goes into some detail about the relationship between \"cue\", \"routine\", and \"reward\".  \n\nIt's not something that will happen instantly, but it does work over time.  The key is not to be upset when they fail - don't be negative about it at all.  Just be positive.

    "answer_type": "Accepted",
    "wrong_answer": "Don't talk - just act:\n\nEvery time the child is coughing without hiding his face in the elbow - not covering the face with the hand, because the virus can be spread by hand shake and then having contact with hands in the face (nose, mouth openings)  - you can order quarantine in the children room.\n\nIf you don't act like this your child and yourself and the whole nation will be in a shut down and national quarantine sooner as you think. And then you will have time for discussions and explanations. (And then the children and all others too will be habit.) \n\nIf we were in a war the authorities would activate the sirens now. This is not the time of apocalyptics but it is the only chance to stop the spreading of this virus and to keep the hospital beds free for people who need it. \n\nThe other alternative would be that everyone has to cough with open mouth that all are infected as soon as possible with probably thousands of deaths. When everyone is infected the virus can't spread any more.\n\nEdit 1:\n\nWe all know that it - covering the face, but not with the hand - should work like an unconditioned reflex. But at it is not unconditioned it has to be conditioned.  There are 2 ways: \n\n\nreinforcement of the goal behavior (that’s what Joe describes)\nor negative consequences = “punishment” of the wrong behavior  (the alternative we don’t prefer)\n\n\nEdit 2:\n\nMy answer 3 days ago was a time out in his room every time the child forgets to cover his face. 3 days we are at the point that all children, coughing are not, can‘t see their grand parents for weeks. And people elder than 65 years are asked to stay inside. A week ago we still were shopping and met young mothers with 4 children in the super market running around. Meanwhile this is forbidden and teenagers are punished if they are in groups outside. Germany, France, Switzerland, Austria ...\n\nChildren are not victims of this virus but they can be infected and spread and there is no time to loose! No time to wait for developing habits. Also in the USA they will be isolated or walk around with a mask.\n\nEdit 3:\n\nAfter the discussion about “praise” vs. “punishment” (s.comments below) I’ve edited  “punishment” = negative consequences. OP clearly says that he has remembered the child (5 years!). He should have learnt it with 3 years. \n\nBtw. I’d like to emphasize that I wrote “wrong” behavior and not “bad”. Unfortunately “punishment” and “praise” is always associated with good and bad. Consequences should be logical (positive or negative).\n\nIt is clear that children - and adults! with naive stereotypes  consider negative consequences = punishment. (Look at the religions: negative consequences lacking of hygiene are interpreted as punishment of the gods. Same problem we have with our bad! dealing and habits with our environment and animals.)\n",

    "answer_id": "39704",
    "answer": "First of all, recognize that your concerns may not be the same as your four year old's concerns. This has two implications:\n\n\nYour child may be worried about things you couldn't have thought of. Your child is likely shielded from or doesn't understand a lot of what's going on, and that can also mean that they don't have access to bits of information that would actually be reassuring. Encourage your child to ask questions about corona, so that they're not left to ponder on their own things that may seem frightening.\nYou are likely worrying about outcomes your child has no thought of. Try not to pass on your own fears to your child. If pre-school is closed and one parent has to stay home from work to care for the child, recognize that this may be viewed as a mainly positive outcome to the child.\n\n\nWith my three year old, I emphasize that all closures and restrictions (writing from Sweden, we're not currently in full lockdown) are not - ultimately - to protect us from disease, but to protect our elderly from catching it from us. I find that framing to be appealing because it's both true, and I imagine it's less scary to a young child to hear how we all have to chip in and make sacrifices to protect another group, than to convey an image that it's actually unsafe for them to step outside.\n\nWhy we should wash our hands and what's so good about vaccines are some things we talk about normally, and the current situation is a good opportunity to put that into context. You can say that it is to avoid this that we vaccinate against a lot of other things, and that scientists are working on a vaccine against this too. That perhaps once your kid will have children of their own, and they will receive a corona vaccine as well in the routine program, and your child will be able to tell their children how they remember what it was like before the vaccine. Washing hands has been a constant battle. Now we've introduced a longer routine, which involves singing a 20-second-long song, and compliance has (temporarily, I assume) increased.\n\nConsider whether you are changing your own behavior in a manner which may require explanation. For instance, if you are suddenly buying groceries in conspicuously larger quantities than normal, or even if they may have seen the images of empty shelves, you may want to point out that you and others are trying to reduce your number of trips to the grocery store, and hence the number of chances you may infect some at-risk person, lest they think that you're actually going to run out of food.\n\nAs an adult, it's easy to become consumed by this. We like to stay updated about what's going on in the world, and this is certainly a main event, and a rapidly evolving one. For my own sake, I could easily bingewatch news for the greater part of the day, and spend the remainder hypothesizing over different future scenarios. Recognize that a young child's world is smaller than yours. Talk about it as a thing that's happening right now, but make sure most of your interactions revolve around normal day to day activities. The above is addressing your question, how to talk about corona, but also make sure you don't talk exclusively about corona.\n",

I'm not saying that it will absolutely work for you, because it depends on the person as well as the cat. My aunt has a kitten who's a little hellion on speed, but plenty of cats are calm. I think it's really worth looking into.\n\nAlso, just remembered a grown man with autism on the show 'Must Love Cats'. He had the same deal going on. Ended up building walkways all through their house for his cats. You can probably find that on youtube.\n",

    "title": "How to protect my children from abusive mother?",
    "question": "I am looking for some urgent advice with how to proceed. My wife is constantly emotionally and physically abusive to both my 3 and 5-year-old. She belittles both, plays favorites, talks about her impending death, threatens them with all manner of scary stories and regularly slaps then on the head or back with an open palm.\n\nI am convinced she has a personality disorder including OCD and NPD (I suggested therapy and was told to f-off). She has been drunk while they are in her care on many occasions as well.\n\nShe is currently a stay-at-home mum, however, we have had a maid since the eldest was born who bathed and fed them, and now I work from home and do most of the cleaning etc.. She is simply a person who wants to continue her life undisturbed by kids, she still has her Friday night (though they can be a midweek one as well) blow-outs, coming home blind drunk and vomiting like clockwork.\n\nI am scared to leave her with the kids as she is extremely lax when it comes to safety. We live on the 38th floor and she has left the balcony door open many times, and now she is not bothered about closing the baby gate and letting the boys run free in the kitchen. Her latest act has been to go clubbing and drinking in pubs during this coronavirus outbreak without taking any precautions and coming home completely wasted. (BTW we live in Hong Kong).\n\nI am writing this from a coffee shop as I have been forced out by her gal pals who are over for drinks. I have endured this for 18 yrs now. I want to get advice on how I can proceed? Do I simply rock up at the CPA and tell them the situation? Why would they believe me? How to prove this? I would give her everything as long as I can care for the boys.\n",
    "answer_id": "39709",
    "answer": "The mother does not seem like she will change her ways. Some people might encourage you to try to talk to her about her treatment of the kids, to give her an ultimatum, but personally I think this could just make the situation worse. You need to get the kids away from her. The best way to do this would be the legal route, unless you greatly expect that she will happily let you have full custody, not wanting to see the kids for them, or out of spite against you. \n\nAny evidence you can get will be very useful. The maid may be able to support what you say, depending on how open your wife is with her mistreatment of the kids. I'd also suggest trying to get some video or audio recordings, but you should look into whether these can be used in court if the other person is not aware that they are being recorded. \n\nIn terms of the kitchen, I suggest kid-proofing it. Try to store any dangerous items out of their reach, and any low cupboards that need to store dangerous items should have childproofing locks.\n",

    "title": "How to minimize covid-19 exposure child visitation with the non-custodial parent?",
    "question": "What practical approaches are recommended or possible to minimize covid-19 exposure during child visitation, weekend visit, with the non-custodial parent?  Are there medical or legal guidelines on this topic?  (I live in Georgia, in the USA.)\n",
    "answer_id": "39770",
    "answer": "First: we are not able to answer legal questions, so don't take this as really addressing the legal side of things.  Look up those details in your area specifically or ask a lawyer for that.\n\nIn general, visitation is likely still possible currently.  See this advice from Nolo:\n\n\n  How do Social Distancing Rules Affect Custody Arrangements?\n  \n  \n    The social distancing and shelter-in-place rules don't directly affect custody orders, so you should continue following your current custody arrangement unless you and your ex agree to an alternative plan or a judge changes your custody order.\n    \n    Courts are making it clear that disobeying court orders or withholding visitation during this time won't be tolerated and may result in contempt of court. But if you have valid concerns about your child's health and safety, you can try communicating with your ex to see what you can both do to reduce the risks to your child.\n    \n    Within a family unit, creating an effective social distancing plan can be as simple as adopting rules for parents and children to follow within their home. But for divorced or separated parents, social distancing and staying healthy when children are going back and forth between two households can be challenging.\n  \n\n\nAn example of a state issuing guidance on this is Delaware:\n\n\n  To be clear, neither the State of Emergency nor the Seventh Modification interferes with or invalidates any existing Family Court order regarding custody or visitation. Custody and visitation orders remain in full force and effect. Travel (including interstate travel) for the purposes of complying with a Family Court order is considered essential travel and permitted. Such travel was deemed essential in Governor Carney’s Fifth Modification to the COVID-19 State of Emergency Declaration issued March 22, 2020. Under the Seventh Modification, such travel remains essential and is excluded from the selfquarantine requirement. \n\n\nCNN indicates that some states have more vague language, however:\n\n\n  Other states have left rulings vague. In Massachusetts, for example, John D. Casey, chief justice of probate and family court, last week issued an open letter that said, \"both parents should cooperate.\"\n\n\nSome states are apparently encouraging (but not requiring) virtual visitation, such as Vermont:\n\n\n  How is the Department for Children and Families dealing with social distancing?\n  \n  \n    According to Johnson, DCF has called its families to ask if they would be willing to have virtual visitations.\n  \n\n\nThat all said: you should consider the risks that visitation would bring.  If your child, or anyone in either household, is in the 'high risk' category, for example a child who is immunocompromised due to medication, or an elderly parent living at home with the family, it may be appropriate to limit or eliminate in person visitation.  That would depend on an agreement between the two parents, though, to modify the arrangements temporarily; it would not be automatic.\n\nIt is highly recommended to have a conversation with your ex-partner, and be clear about your concerns and open to creative ideas.  It may be safer to have fewer handoffs for longer periods of time - if it is normally 5 days / 2 days, then perhaps 3 weeks / 1 week is possible, for example, if the normally noncustodial parent is not working or is working at home and able to spend time with the child.  The linked CNN article above has more recommendations along these lines.  \n\nFacetime/Skype/Zoom/etc. are good options for maintaining contact with the child without personal contact.  Many activities can take place over videochat; reading a book to them, playing a board game virtually (one person moves pieces for the other player of course; or some games, like Battleship, can be played completely remotely); online games, of course, as well.  \n",

That unique is the gift.\n\nAnd remember, opening the box on something new can only be done once. After that, it would be the same as opening the box on a re-packaged second-hand item, even if the toy was brand new the day before.\n",

    "title": "What is a likely cause of this glow in my photos?",
    "question": "I have been using a Nikon D5200 with a Tamron 100-400 zoom for wildlife photography. It's admittedly a budget setup (in some sense of the term \"budget\"), so I don't expect amazing results. I'm also not a trained photographer, and I've pretty much learned by reading the internet and youtube (not ideal, I know). Recently, I decided to rent a different Nikon body for an expedition (which ultimately got canceled due to COVID-19).\n\nI decided to rent a mirrorless Nikon Z6 to see how I would like a mirrorless camera, and to try a full-frame sensor, and also just to get a newer sensor and body and see how the quality compares, using the same Tamron lens.\n\nI made a lot of mistakes in using the new body, but ultimately I'm stumped still. The photos are displaying the same annoying glow that I've seen with the old body. I don't know what is causing it, but it seems like I can narrow it down to \"operator\" or lens errors.\n\n\n\nIn the image above, a heavily cropped section of a photo of a bird, you can see the glow. It shows up similarly using either body. This is shot at 400mm, ISO 320 f/6.3, 1/500 sec. \n\nI handhold the camera most of the time because I just can't use a tripod for most of these photos (the birds are up in a tree, jumping around, etc.)\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for what I should do here? Should I use faster shutter speed and higher ISO? I've tried that and found that I get a lot of noise, but maybe the newer sensors can handle it? I'd be willing to spend some $$ on a book or read any references people might recommend. \n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT\nThis image is uncorrected, straight out of the camera, though (sadly) I took it as a JPG originally. I usually shoot raw, but had my settings incorrect for this new body that I'm renting. I see the same effect whether it's RAW or JPG though, it was just that this photo showed the effect more strongly so that I could illustrate my question.\n",

If you apply after 90 days, the cost rises from €25 to €340.  If you apply within 90 days but they drag their feet, the cost should remain €25, so, because you moved in October and applied in October, you should be paying the lower fee.  There is no other penalty for a late application; in particular, you cannot be deported.\n\nYou write:\n\n\n  We traveled inside Europe from the time we arrived in the summer of 2015 until we moved into our new house in France in October of 2016 (15 months). I did not secure a residency permit anywhere, because we were staying with friends and didn't really have a permanent residence. Perhaps I should have applied for the CDS when we signed for the house in January 2016, even though we really weren't staying in France for extended periods. Just trying to find out if it's going be surmountable after all this time.\n\n\nYes, it will be surmountable.  As mentioned, the only real question is whether to charge you €25 or €340.  I do not know exactly what criteria they would use to assert that you owe the higher fee, however.  If you were never in France for more than 90 days, then they probably cannot charge the higher fee.  If you were in France for more than 90 days, uninterrupted, before filing your application, then they certainly can charge you the higher fee.  If you were in France for more than 90 days, and then left, and then moved to France, they might argue that the higher fee is due, and although I doubt that this would stand up in court, the cost of a court battle is not justified by the €315 difference.\n\nThe 90 day period is triggered by your arrival in France, not your purchase of property.  If you were based in France for your 15-month travels in Europe, then you should arguably have applied for the card then; a short trip away from France would generally be held not to interrupt your period of residence.  On the other hand, if you were in France for just a few days, but spent most of your time in Germany or indeed anywhere else in the world, it would be difficult to argue that you had established yourself in France at that point or that your period of residence should be said to have started then.  In any event, their interest in your whereabouts seems consistent with an inquiry into whether to charge the higher fee, but whether that is the real reason or not is still unclear.\n\nIt seems, however, that your major worry is whether they can deny the carte de séjour altogether.  In general, they cannot.\n\nMore precisely, they can deny it only on very limited grounds, which almost certainly do not apply.  The grounds are:\n\n\nYour husband is not an EU citizen\nYour marriage to your husband is not valid\nYou and your husband, as \"economically inactive\" people, are not able to support yourselves\nYou or your husband are a danger to public health\nYou or your husband are a danger to public safety\nYour or your husband's presence in France is contrary to public policy\n\n\nThe third item, being able to support yourselves, is only necessary for the first five years; after that time, you gain a right of permanent residence in France.\n",

The social security number however is valid for life.\n\nNevertheless, if she enters using her green card the worst the immigration officer can do is refer her to immigration court. They cannot turn her away. It is only an immigration judge who has that authority to declare definitively that the permanent residence was abandoned\n\nNote that the determination of abandonment by the immigration officer at the airport is discretionary. There is no defined time period after which when a person is away they are determined to have definitely abandoned residence. They are presumed to have abandoned after one year away however if they can provide evidence to show it was out of their control, the immigration judge can make a ruling that they did not intend to abandon it and hence reinstate it.\n\nI personally know someone who returned after almost two years and was let in. The immigration officer didn’t even interrogate in-depth why he was away almost two years. He never filed the reentry permit document to protect his residency or got an SB-1.\n\nIn this case I don’t think you want to drag your child through immigration court just to save $1500 or so. Additionally the 5 years absence was prolonged so prospects of winning in immigration court are low.\n\nThe problem however is even though she has a nonimmigrant visa, if she enters using the visa she can be turned away at the airport if they dig a little because they can reasonably assume she has immigrant intent and that she is only coming on the visa for convenience and you will file for her when she arrives. That will cause major problems for you. Also remember you will have to wait some months after she arrives before filing for her because of the 90 day rule.\n\n\n  90-Day Rule\n  \n  Although USCIS has not updated their Policy Manual with a similar\n  rule, adjustment of status applicants would be prudent to assume the\n  same guideline is in place. For example, many attorneys are now\n  advising their clients to avoid marriage and adjustment of status\n  within at least the first 90 days of entry.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nShe should formally abandon the permanent residence, then enter on the visa. If questioned she will have to say she’s only visiting her parents. Then 91 days later, you can file a new permanent residence application for her.\nAlternatively you can let her wait in India while you petition her from scratch and not use the nonimmigrant visa because technically it would be fraudulent to enter with a nonimmigrant visa knowing full well you are going to adjust status.\n\n",

    "question": "My Instructor residence status for Japan is valid until 2022. I left Japan two months ago to visit my country of citizenship, the US, with the intention of returning and starting a new job before 90 days had elapsed. Due to unforseen circumstances, I'm having to postpone my return to and employment in Japan until August or September.\n\nI notified Immigration using the required form within several days of finishing my last employment, and got a \"Special Re-entry Permit\", valid for 1 year, stapled in my passport at the airport when I left the country (I have my zairyu card). However, my understanding is that my residence status can be revoked after 90 days of not engaging in my \"designated activity\".\n\nIf I accept an offer for a job in Japan starting in August or September, what should I do about my residence status?

    "answer_id": "105999",
    "answer": "Absolutely there is a way to propagate yeast, it's as simple as making a starter with it. Most of the time these days people create starters for sourdough using natural yeasts, but you can use them to feed any kind of yeast. All you would do is put flour and water in a container with some yeast, let it get to work and once you start to get bubbles put it in the fridge to slow it down. You would then use half of it for every batch of bread you make, replacing the flour and water to keep it at the same quantity. \n\nIf you don't use any of it for a few days you'd want to throw half away and refill in order to give the yeast a fresh supply of food. You can share this with as many people as you like, just split it into two, give each a fresh supply of flour and water, and repeat as many times as necessary. Using this technique a small amount of yeast could theoretically supply the entire planet. \n\nNOTE: During the Coronavirus outbreak it's worth noting that corona can survive on surfaces for quite some time, so you should take great care to ensure that your yeast propagation does not lead to virus propagation!\n",

I would recommended poaching them instead.  If you cut them up first, go with my original recommendation of an hour.  If they went in whole, I might give it two hours.

It seems that the prices are reaching the values they were at before the 2008 recession. Is it reasonable to expect them to drop similarly to how they did 12 years ago?

    "answer_id": "120723",
    "answer": "You can't make a market prediction based purely on the current market value. The value is a function of supply and demand. To make any sort of reasonable prediction you would need to understand population in your area and predictions on population growth/shrinkage, demographics e.g. are the sort of people who would buy an apartment likely to increase as a proportion of the population in your area, and are there already any house building initiatives planned in your area to meet any expected population growth. These are some of the immediate local indicators which is possible to find out about. Then there may also be macro/global factors which may not be possible to predict e.g. if coronavirus suddenly wiped out 5% of global population what effect would that have on global property demand?

Before I explain it, let me mention some selected popular questions on this site in which the consensus is that in the long term a broad investment in the stock market will yield a substantially positive average annual return rate:\n\nWhy should we expect stocks to go up in the long term?\n\nWhy do people claim that Stock Markets are broadly exponential in the long term?\n\nWhy isn't everybody rich?\n\nStock market long term risks\n\nIs it a lie that you can easily make money passively in the stock market?\n\nAre Index Funds really as good as “experts” claim?\n\nIn view of all this consensus, we can almost say that it has become \"common knowledge\" that investing in the broad stock market (sufficient diversification) on a long term perspective (several decades) is a very good investment strategy. More precisely, the consensus seems to be that there is some average annual return rate, say 3% (replace this number by something higher/lower if you prefer), such that if your investment is diversified enough and your timespan is long enough, the risk that your actual average annual return rate drops below that rate tends towards zero.\n\nNow comes the first question: Why doesn't any (serious) bank offer a savings account with a fixed 2% interest rate for an unlimited amount of time? \n\nAfter all, a large bank has the optimal prerequisites for diversification and holding stocks for many decades, and if the above is true, then they would still earn at least 1% of their customer's account values each year by essentially doing not very much except buying and selling some index funds according to what customers want to withdraw or pay in. \n\nMy own first objection to the question would be the following: If there is a market crash and at the same time a lot of customers want to withdraw money from their accounts, the bank might be in big trouble because the total value of the stocks owned by the bank could be less than what the customers want to withdraw.\n\nHowever, I feel that this is not really an objection because even without the above \"obvious product\" banks will always be in trouble if their customers want to withdraw too much money at once. \n\nWhat's bothering me even more is the\n\nSecond question: Why don't all banks borrow a huge amount of money from the central bank and invest it in the stock market on a broad, long-term basis? \n\nAs far as I know, banks can borrow money from the central bank at quite low interest rates (much less than the expected long-term average annual return rate of the broad stock market), in Europe that interest rate is currently even negative. So why don't all banks just buy index funds using this free money and just hold them forever, watching them grow in value?\n\n\n\nEdit: After the first few answers (and some downvotes) I immediately realized that it was a big mistake to specialize the question in the sense that I only asked why banks don't do the \"obvious\" things, rather than having simply asked why no-one or  no specialized company does the \"obvious\" things. I am very glad that in the further course of events my question was received in a slightly more abstract way.

    "answer": "Fundamentally, I think there's a high level (and perhaps unsatisfying) answer to this. It's because that's not \"banking\" as a business, and a bank is established to do banking, not to get into the stock market. In other words, this question strikes me about the same as asking,\n\n\n  why don't ice cream shops stop selling ice cream, and instead get in the business of selling pancakes? After all, you can make a lot of money selling pancakes.\n\n\nWell yes, you can get rich selling pancakes, but not every business is a pancake shop. Certainly, some businesses get rich selling pancakes, but other businesses with different motivations and risk tolerances decide to sell ice cream instead.\n\nTo make this clear in your banking context: such a business would essentially be called a hedge fund or investment management company, not a bank. It's fine if a company wants to be a hedge fund, but a company that is calling itself a bank can't secretly switch over to being a hedge fund, and still call itself a bank while supporting \"banking\" activities for normal consumers.\n\nFrom a more practical perspective, most jurisdictions have carefully developed regulations that would essentially prohibit a business calling itself a bank from doing what you're discussing. Essentially, these regulations exist because of my first point - the business model you're describing isn't \"banking.\" And, regulations are designed around that, in the sense that regulations keep banks acting like banks and stop them from trying to act like something that isn't a bank.\n\nI'm editing to clarify a portion of your question, as an example of this disconnect. You said,\n\n\n  As far as I know, banks can borrow money from the central bank at quite low interest rates\n\n\nThat's not really the whole story. Think of it this way. Imagine if you were to walk into a retail bank right now, and ask for a loan for a million dollars. The bank would certainly ask you some questions, including asking what you intended to do with that money and how you could show proof that you are able to pay it back. If you were able to prove that you have a large and stable income, and that you were planning on using the million dollars to purchase a home that's actually worth a million dollars, you might get approved. But what if you told the bank, \"I'm actually empty handed, but I'm going to go invest this in the stock market, I think I have a proven way to make a positive return\" - they might deny you on the spot, or at least they might have a lot more questions for you!\n\nThe relationship between central banks and retail banks is fundamentally similar. A retail bank can't just call up the central bank and say, \"please wire me a billion dollars\" and instantly, the money shows up. Retail banks essentially have to go through a process of validating their operational intentions, showing proof that they can pay the loan back, and perhaps even putting up collateral, before the money changes hands. And, a retail bank with no collateral who indicated that they wanted to play the stock market would almost certainly get turned down by the central bank.\n\nI'm making another edit to address another core flaw in your assumptions. You said,\n\n\n  we can almost say that it has become \"common knowledge\" that investing in the broad stock market (sufficient diversification) on a long term perspective (several decades) is a very good investment strategy\n\n\nWhile that may be a sound theory it's not a practical method for a bank to keep or invest assets, because of liquidity and predictability. It may be accurate to say that \"in the long term\" a diversified stock portfolio can be bulletproof. But banks can't issue cash to deposit customers based on long term theories. They have to be able to predict the availability of funds very well - the stability of their outcomes, not just the expected result. In other words, if a bank has $10 billion in assets, they need to know precisely how much of that will be available to them tomorrow, or next Tuesday, or in six months. Your stock market theory may have the right expected outcome (positive growth), but it's got far too much potential variance on any particular day. Yes, \"in the long run\" you may make money, but can you tell me exactly how much cash you'll have next Tuesday? No, you can't. You might have an acceptable expected outcome on Average for all \"next Tuesdays\" - but what if coronavirus takes off in the US this weekend? Or something else happens? Banks aren't just concerned about the expected outcome, they're also concerned about variability in the range of expected outcomes. People do \"banking activities\" like deposit their paycheck into a deposit account, or take out a credit card loan, with the expectation of stability and availability of funds. Those \"features\" which are essentially the definition of retail banking come as a trade off in terms of a slightly lower return (compared to your stock market portfolio).\n",

    "question": "For example, if I am trading a SP500 ETF on the NYSE, the stock exchange opens at 3:30pm CET. Due to the time shift, the stock exchanges in the EU open at 9am CET, meaning I can already gather chart information from SP500 ETFs that are traded here. \n\nReal life example: The SP500 ETF (even though it's the one traded on an EU stock exchange) gains a lot of value again after the corona virus crash. Is it practically possible to use this information to my advantage by immediately buying shares at the NYSE when it opens later? I know that technically the charts aren't connected with each other as each stock exchange trades it's own shares but in reality they are still correlating. \n\nTo be fair, due to the duration of an order I think it wouldn't be possible to take advantage of this small marge, but what about big banks with higher volume and high speed trading?\n",

Is it practically possible to use this information to my advantage by immediately buying shares at the NYSE when it opens later?\n\n\nNo. The simple reason why is that even if you buy immediately when the market opens, that's still too late.\n\nAs an example, imagine that there's a single ETF which trades both in the United States (from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm US Eastern time) and in Great Britain (from 4:30 am to 11:00 am US Eastern time).\n\nNow let's imagine that it's 4:30 am Eastern, and the ETF begins trading at $80. However, the price of the ETF increases over the course of the day, so that by 9:25 am Eastern, the price of the ETF is $100.\n\nCan you take advantage of this by buying shares of the ETF in the United States immediately upon open? No, because when it starts trading in the United States, it will start trading at about $100, not at $80. You'll be paying $100 for shares worth $100, which is, of course, a profit of $0.\n\nMaybe you're thinking that when the market opens, the opening price is the same as the previous day's closing price. This is not the case. The market won't open at $80 and then immediately rise to $100; it will simply open at $100.\n",

    "title": "Buy apartment now despite corona crisis?",
    "question": "I am about to buy an apartment (in a major city in central Europe) to live in, mostly with borrowed capital (around 80%). The price was set before the financial crisis due to the corona virus started. Should I change my plans? Is there any possibility of saying whether the crisis also had an impact on the real estate prices so far? My personal situation is stable in the sense that my job is rather safe despite the crisis. Should I continue to buy the apartment as planned?\n\nNote: I am aware that the future cannot be predicted, what I want to find out is the following: Since the price for \"my\" apartment was set before the corona crisis started, is there already any evidence that the real estate prices in major cities in central Europe have taken a hit? I.e. I am not asking about the future development but rather about a comparison of the situation before the corona crisis to the present situation. \nIt would also be interesting whether in the past the stock market was correlated with the real estate prices, particularly during / after crises.\n",
    "answer_id": "121618",
    "answer": "It's unlikely that you would be able to have firm evidence of a sudden drop in price so rapidly. Reason for that is that the real estate market is a bit peculiar: Transactions take time to put together and it can take a long time for prices to adjust. The real estate market is not nearly as liquid as the stock market, international commodity markets or flower auctions.\n\nWhen there is a real estate crash, it's common for the number of transactions to drop while buyers and sellers figure out the new price. Sellers, especially individuals who have a lot invested in their house, a (possibly underwater) mortgage to pay back, etc. are not ready to lower their asking price at once. Some might prefer to sell their house for the same price several years later rather than selling it at its real price right now. Buyers who are concerned about paying too much (like yourself) wait for the price to feel more reasonable relative to everything else. Those who need to sell a house before buying another one might also be stuck. And nobody knows exactly where the market might clear in between.\n\nBut, right now, you would not expect many real estate transactions to be happening in Europe. Real estate agencies are forced to close in several countries, it's not possible to visit houses, etc. So it's difficult to have any idea of what the current prices are, whether the drop in the number of transactions reflects a drop in the underlying market or is just a side-effect of the current measures to fight the pandemic, or how fast everything is going to go back to normal.\n",
    "answer_type": "Accepted",
    "wrong_answer": "\nmostly with borrowed capital (around 80%)\n\n\nThis is too high in my opinion. There has been a period in history in Amsterdam when real house prices fell 80%, leaving only 20% (source). True, it happened over a period of 37 years (1778-1815). Shorter term crashes are usually more limited, easily leaving 50% of the house price value left. If you pay your loan back quickly, you could fund more than 50% of your house with borrowed capital. 60%? Definitely. 70%? Maybe if you pay your loan back very quickly. But I would not fund 80% with borrowed capital.\n\n\nIs there any possibility of saying whether the crisis will have an impact on the real estate prices?\n\n\nAnything is possible. In particular, investments (real estate, bonds, stocks) tend to be correlated. We now know that stock yields have increased and equivalently prices have reduced. Whether the same happens to real estate prices is anyone's guess.\n\n\nShould I continue to buy the apartment as planned?\n\n\nYou should note that alternative investment options have reduced in value and increased in yield. For example, a major hydropower/nuclear power producing company in my area has a dividend yield of 8%. Add to that 2% of inflation, and you have 10% nominal yield. (It only distributes some of the earnings back as dividend, so part of it is reinvested, so the nominal yield could even exceed 10%).\n\nSo, do a quick calculation. How much yield would a stock investment have? How much yield would a real estate investment have (in avoided rental costs)? Take into account all estimated maintenance a real estate investment would have in a period of 50-100 years.\n\nI can't say definite yes or no, but in the area where I live, the answer is a clear no. House prices would need to fall by a huge amount to make living in an owner-occupied house profitable, when considering alternative investments (stocks).\n",

    "answer": "The critical question is posed in a comment by BernhardDöbler: do you need this money soon?\n\nThe danger in selling is that you may be following the pattern of many casual investors: fear of missing out drives them to buy stocks when the market is very strong and then fear of losing all drives them to sell when the market is very weak. They end up \"buying high and selling low\" which is a guaranteed way to lose money. \n\nOn the other hand, if you do need the money in the near term, you pretty much have to accept the loss and sell. Whether you should sell now or a month from now is probably not answerable by anybody without a crystal ball.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 pandemic, the market has just received a solid wallop of information that a bunch of companies are not going to make nearly as much money this year as they thought they were. Some companies may experience a cash flow crisis that bankrupts them. If you own individual stocks and have the analysis skills, you might review your holdings and try to figure out if any of the companies you hold are in danger of going under. If your retirement is in index funds that you don't need for a few years, then I'd suggest sitting tight. Eventually the pandemic will end, planes will start flying again, and the markets will likely return to some semblance of normal.\n",

There are always people willing to buy at a low enough price. Furthermore, the price reported for a stock is the last price at which the stock was sold. If demand for the stock were to fall to 0, there would simply be no liquidity (no shares of the stock bought or sold), but the share price would still be reported at whatever the last transaction price was. The effect on shareholders would be that they would not be able to sell their stock (because there's no demand). They'd have to hold it until someone is willing to buy it.\n",

    "answer": "This idea of an extended \"market holiday\" is a completely normal idea.  A lot of people have had this idea, especially today, and I'll tell you below why it's terrible.  Just flat-out bad.  I once had this idea during the GFC when I was also new-ish to the market, so don't feel bad.  \n\nI believe one of the CNBC hosts was touting this idea this morning.  A simple way to refute one of the underlying notions here is thus: If you don't like what you see then just go ahead and close your eyes, and the bad thing will go away right?  Of course not.\n\nYou might say \"Maybe the market just doesn't know what stocks are worth right now and that's why the market is down.\"  I'd answer  that no one ever really knows exactly what a business/stock is worth (some exceptions aside).  Generally, people who sell think it's worth less than the price and people who buy think it's worth more, so why do we need to shut the market?  \n\nYou might say \"Maybe not everyone feels comfortable trading or feels like they know what this specific business/stock is worth right now so that's why we should halt trading.\"  I'd answer with why can't the people that do want to trade continue trading and if you don't know/ just aren't \"comfortable\" then step aside, no one is forced to trade (unless maybe they used leverage/need the money).  \n\nThe punchline on extended market holidays, reiterated: Except in cases of traders or technology used to trade actually being unavailable/overtaxed for some reason, it's something we should avoid at all costs.  There are lots of negatives, and I'm not aware of any positives outside of the corner cases mentioned above.\n\nA surprise trading halt as you mentioned of an extended variety is one of the worst things that can be done to a market.  Imagine...\n\n\nSurprise! That thing you owned that you thought was liquid and you could buy or sell on most days Monday-Friday, excepting holidays, actually isn't!  And if you need to raise money between now and the market re-opening, tough! \nWhen the market does re-open, going forward, everything in that market should be priced more cheaply in one respect, and that is to account for a new illiquidity premium that has been introduced to the market.  All else equal, if you could own the same stock on two exchanges and one had random extended trading halts while the other didn't, there should be a disparity in the pricing, albeit not massive, between the two.  I'd rather own the one that trades more frequently.  Illiquidity in an asset is not a good thing.  \nJust because something isn't trading and its price stays the same doesn't mean its value is not changing, it just means that it's harder to estimate(no one can truly see it) that true value.  It's quite possible that when the market reopened some of the companies would be worthless.  See the bullet two down on the economy for more info here. \nIt's harder for everyone to deal in securities that have random extended halts because of those halts, which hurts liquidity even further going forward.  Less liquidity is bad.\nThe rest of the economy would continue to function, but not as well as it would with the market open.  So many transactions happen in the market on a daily basis and while some of these are retail or professional investors trading in the market, many of these trades are transactions where one company is hedging their exposure to another company.  Or, just using the market to see a gauge of the health of their counterparty to determine if they're going to engage in a business transaction and if so at what level with what other terms.  Imagine one company is buying components from another.  Each will look at the markets to judge the health of the other in their negotiations.  Without functioning markets, that process gets more difficult and it is exponentially more difficult at times of stress when companies are worried about the health of other companies.  That is when it is most important for markets to be open.  If markets are not, distrust reigns and activity/deals between companies grind to a halt.  That harms the economy.\nClosing the market doesn't allow companies to think longer term.  Closing the market causes everyone to speculate which companies are in credit trouble and won't be around.  Others seek to limit or avoid exposure to the firms that might be failing by cancelling orders and halting shipments. Just the rumor that someone is in trouble will cause others to stop dealing with that firm and then it really is over for the company in question.  If the market was open that didn't have to happen.\nThe \"chaos\" you describe is simply the process of price discovery in times of uncertain economic outlook.  The market is volatile, it is what it is.  Instead of wondering what companies are likely worth for the next two months we can let them trade and have a best estimate.  That's what the market is, an estimating machine for the value of businesses. \nThose values are very important to businesses as they do business with each other.  The stock market is not some pure speculation machine/ random number generator that pushes values around willy-nilly.    \nThink of it this way: Maybe I don't like when prices change so we should just have stocks trade once a year, then everyone can really \"plan long term?\"  That sounds ludicrous right?  It's the same idea.\nThe world is a scarier place, companies are making less, businesses are hurting, people are dying and stocks are worth less as a result.  Closing our eyes won't make the situation any better.  Restricting trade by closing the market would hurt the underlying economy.  Trade is generally a pretty good thing.\n\n",

    "wrong_answer": "The simple reason is that they don't need and can't use liquidity; they know when they expect their foreign currency denominated cashflows will fall (within a reasonable range of dates) so they buy futures with the intention of taking delivery at maturity. OK that's not entirely true because the futures normally deliver financially rather than as an FX trade but the maths shows that the outcome is equivalent.\n\nOne other key thing to consider is that the company wants to lock in the exchange rate in the future, at the time when the cashflow occurs, rather than the current exchange rate. It doesn't matter (much) whether that rate is better or worse than spot, it is the rate they need to make their exchange at.\n\nSo, what the companies are doing is hedging the exchange rate that their future cashflows will be exchanged at rather than hedging the exchange rate at the current time but there is another, linked, reason why they don't make the exchange at spot in the current period; they don't actually have the cash to do so right now. These future cashflows have not been realised yet so they literally don't have the cash to spare now to convert to or from a different currency to complete the trade that you are suggesting. They will only have the cash available at the date when the exchange needs to be done so how can they use that cash in the current period?\n",

Therefore, banks are legally limited in what they can do with it while you're entrusting it to them. Yes, the bank does lend that money to other depositors, putting it at some risk, but they are heavily regulated on how they do that. Ideally, since you can never lose your deposit, the bank isn't allowed to lose it either. Deposit accounts are guaranteed (up to $250,000) by the FDIC, which has regulatory power over commercial deposit banks and can preemptively shut down or otherwise intervene to ensure banks can make good on their deposits.\n\nInvestment (brokerage) accounts, on the other hand, are for the purpose of purchasing (possibly risky) investments that can potentially lose money. Any investments you make, you're on your own. The bank is only required to prohibit you from doing a few specific things thay are very risky and/or stupid. The \"cash\" portion of your investment account is money that the bank can use to purchase it's own (possibly risky) investments. Although they have a fiduciary requirement to protect your money, this is not the same thing as a guarantee. Investment banks are insured by the SIPC, but unlike the FDIC, it has no regulatory power and does not insure the actual value of your investments.\n\nIn short, banks have much more flexibility with investment money than they do with deposit money. This is why you have to do a transfer before you can invest.\n\nThe reason things are this way is because of some very shady activities that banks were engaging in during the Great Depression, and during the subprime mortgage crisis.\n",

    "question": "Quoting wikipedia:\n\n\n  On March 16, 2020, amid an economic crisis caused by the 2020\n  coronavirus pandemic, for the first time since the inception of the\n  Federal Reserve, the fractional reserve requirement was reduced to\n  0%.[11]\n\n\nNow question is why would banks not approve a loan? Worst case they get 0 $ back, but that does not mean that they lost money since credit was created out of thin air so even if every credit defaults they still will not loose any money and anything they get back is pure profit.\n\nnote:for simplification this assumes that cost of processing a loan is 0% for bank, we know that realistically they need to pay their employees.\n",
    "answer_id": "121772",
    "answer": "\n  Worst case they get 0 $ back, but that does not mean that they lost money since credit was created out of thin air so even if every credit defaults they still will not loose any money and anything they get back is pure profit.\n\n\nObviously if a bank never lost money by not getting paid back they would make loans all day long, even ones they knew they would not get paid back on.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is, a bank's profits are based on how much they actually make on the loan beyond the cost of the loan itself.  The cost of the loan includes the principle which must be paid back.   What you refer to as being created \"out of thin air\" doesn't mean that money is being created from nothing, it is referring to the fact that the same money can be loaned out multiple times, effectively creating what appears to be actual money several times in excess of the actual amount of money floating around.\n\nAnother way of looking at it is that a bank generally isn't lending its own money.  They get the money from other sources and lend it out at higher rates than they pay, and from the excess the pay their expenses and hopefully have some profits left over.  So if you put $100 in an account at the bank, the bank can lend that $100 out and earn interest on the money, but at the end of the day, they still owe you $100 on demand whenever you ask for it.  The \"created out of thin air\" comes from the fact that the person who lends the money will need to put the money somewhere, most likely either the same or a different bank, or if they use the money to pay somebody else, that person most likely will deposit the same money in the bank, so ultimately, most of the money they lend out stays in the banking system where it can be lent out again.\n\nThe fractional reserve requirement just states how much of that money can be lent out again in the aggregate.  A 0% reserve requirement basically means the bank can lend it all out again.  It doesn't mean that they will be able to (only so much money in loans is being sought at any given time) nor does it reduce the fiduciary requirements to make good loans that are likely to get paid back.\n",

Here's my strategy:\n\nSet up a strangle 5% above and below the market price expiring a month from the day of trade. 12 contracts total. \n\nOn Feb 20th, I looked at the cost of that setup:\n\nActual price of the stock ($SPY) = $336.40\nSell a Call 5% above the market (SPY200320C00355000) = $0.13 x 100 x 12 = + $156.00\nSell a Put 5% below the market (SPY200320P00319000) = $1.42 x 100 x 12 = + $1,704.00\nSo on Feb 20th, I would have received $1,860.00 for selling those options.\n\n\nA month later, the idea is that one of those options would be worthless and the other one cheaper than the price paid (of course this was not the case with the current market/Covid-19)\n\nOn Mar 20th, I would have to pay back\n\nCurrent price of the stock ($SPY) = $244.41\nSPY200320C00355000 is now worth $0.01 = $12\nSPY200320P00319000 is now worth $77.10 = $92,520.00\n\n\nleaving me with a total of $ -90,660.00\n\nAlthough it is clear that this strategy backfired given the current situation, I would like to understand if my calculations are right. \n\nMore specifically, do I have to consider the fact that for every point that an index option goes beyond the strike, I will have to pay/earn $100?

    "answer_id": "121822",
    "answer": "I think there's a few things you may be misunderstanding about selling a strangle. \n\nFirst: \n\n\n  A month later, the idea is that one of those options would be worthless and the other one cheaper than the price paid (of course this was not the case with the current market/Covid-19)\n\n\nThe ideal scenario behind selling a strangle is that both options expire OTM, as they were OTM when you sold them to begin with (in your example, on February 20th). This would result in you keeping all of the premium you initially received, the $1860.00 (not including commissions associated w/ selling these options, which can vary depending on your account, but we'll assume no commissions for the sake of the theoretical scenario). \n\nSecond part: \n\n\n  More specifically, do I have to consider the fact that for every point that an index option goes beyond the strike, I will have to pay/earn $100? If this is the case, I would have to pay an additional 9,200 per contract (?), or $110,400\n\n\nOne, SPY isn't an index and if you wanted to sell options on an index, you could simply sell them on $SPX. Two, I think you're neglecting the fact that movements in the underlying are not the only factor that affects the value of an option, you also have time, and volatility (in a simplified sense) that affect the value of the option you sold. So you can't simply just use this rule of thumb without taking these into account, unless you're saying you are only concerned with what the price the option is on the day of expiration. In this scenario, then yes you'd be only concerned with the difference between the underlying, and the strike price of your option. \n\nSo regarding the 319 Put that was sold at $1.42 a contract, then on the day of expiration (March 20th) this put would be worth $74.59 a contract, and in your example, this could either get exercised against you (if you let it) and in that case, you'd have to buy 100 * 12 = 1200 shares of SPY at $319.00 which would cost: \n\n$319.00 * 1200 = $382,800 and then your position is actually currently worth $244.41 * 1200 = $293,292 so your loss would be: \n\n$(293,292 - 382,800) + $1860 = $-87,648 (recall the $1860 in premium you received initially)\n\nOr more commonly, you would have to buy back the option to close out the contract (since you sold to open the contract), which would cost: $74.59 * 100 * 12 = $89,508. Note that the call would expire OTM (worthless) and you don't have to buy it back. But, recall that you initially received $1,860.00 in premium when you sold these two contracts, so your total loss is: $87,648. \n",

It's sort of like asking if stocks are going to go up or down.  I'll list here the three big things that will determine the value of the USD in the medium term.  There are many others but I believe these to be the big ones.\n\n(1) The decrease in economic activity as a result of the coronavirus should be strongly deflationary.  This can increase the amount of stuff that a dollar can buy because there isn't as much demand for the stuff.  So effectively the dollar strengthens.\n\n(2) A flight to safety during time of stress where the USD is generally considered the safest currency.  The dollar has generally been strengthening against other currencies.  Part of this strengthening has been related though to the fact that a lot of borrowing happens in USD and when you borrow USD and then lose money you have to pay back the USD that you lost.  This has meant dollar buying, which has certainly contributed to the recent dollar strength.\n\n(3) Stimulus/relief efforts on the part of the federal gov't to counteract the economic effects of the virus mean more debt to GDP.  Giving people money to spend like this in inflationary, which should reduce the value of the dollar.  The more debt you have relative to your ability to pay, then the more those lending to you should theoretically charge you in interest because you are a riskier borrower and less likely to make good on all of your payments. \n\nSo we have two deflationary effects and one large inflationary effect.  The depth and length of the crisis will determine how much dollar \"strength\"* we see from #1 and #2, and the gov't response to the depth and breadth of the crisis will determine #3.  They're intertwined.\n\n*Here strength is relative to the price of goods and used in the deflationary sense of strength.\n",

    "question": "I am in the process of making an offer for a house. Wife and I have about 135K saved, with steady jobs, both happen to be an 'essential business' as required for this period during the corona virus.\n\nInitially, I wanted to put 20% down (about 74K) to avoid PMI and have lower monthly payments.\n\nI have since reversed course on this. I think 10% (about 37K) is better, and here is my reasoning. PMI calculators online suggest the PMI will be about 150 a month. 37K invested returns should be more than double the yearly PMI payments during an average year. We plan on being in this house for the foreseeable future, so I am playing the long game with this chunk of investment. We can also have the option to make a chunk payment in the future to bring it to 20% equity and get the PMI taken off if we choose. Also, this gives us access to this cash in a more liquid form during these unsure times.\n\nDoes this reasoning make sense? With a long term outlook, would it still be wise to sink the extra 37K into the house and get rid of the PMI?\n",
    "answer_id": "122037",
    "answer": "Short answer: \nIt probably makes sense to avoid the PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance), but it ultimately depends on how probable it is that you are unable to pay the monthly installments with/without the extra savings. \n\nLong answer:\nWhile i am not an expert on the specifics of the US mortgage market (I presume the question pertains to US), it seems that a PMI (or an increment of the overall interest rate charged on the loan) varies between 0.5% and 2% p.a. and is charged on the overall loan amount (90% in this case). Your loan amount works out to 333k from the provided information and your annual PMI payment to 1800. This puts it on the lower end with 0.54%. \n\nThat means that with the 37k you plan to invest instead of paying down, you have to earn 4.9% p.a. plus the normal mortgage interest rate on those 37k - all this net of tax (assuming you get no tax deduction on your mortgage/PMI payments). This seems like a tall order compared to a \"risk-free\" savings you realize by having a lower mortgage interest rate on the overall loan amount without the PMI. So based on risk/return considerations alone, you are probably better off avoiding the PMI. Only a very low PMI rate would result a different outcome from that perspective.\n\nAnother consideration to make is whether putting the 37k aside instead of using them for a down payment would improve your worst-case scenario and could buy you additional time in case you have difficulties repaying the mortgage. Only you can figure out how much this \"option\" is worth, considering how secure your and your spouse's incomes are, what are you going to do with the 61k that remain even if you choose to pay down  and how much the monthly mortgage repayment is, compared to your income. Based on the information you provided, it seems that the 61k can last you for a significant period of mortgage repayments, so that the value of any additional cushion is probably very small.\n",

    "answer": "Market reactions to information are not always timely, proportional, or rational. \n\nWe don't know the full impact of our current situation; we're feeling it out.\n\n\nSome people (bulls), believe that the initial dip was an over-reaction, that the government response will prevent further decline, and/or that things will go back to normal pretty quickly, so they are buying the dip.\nOn the other side you have people (bears) that believe the initial reaction was just a start but not enough to price-in the full impact, that the government can't prop up the economy, and/or that this will drag on for a long while, so they are betting on further decline. \n\n\nThe problem with this idea of information being priced-in is that we all know there's a global pandemic, but there are very different opinions about how much that should affect the market.\n\nConsider unemployment levels: We have projections about unemployment rate potentially hitting a peak over 30%. Meanwhile, the current unemployment rate is 4.4% and projected to hit double digits in April. The only way all of that information could be appropriately priced in is if everyone agreed about the reasonableness of the projections and had the economic prowess to understand the actual impact of those figures.\n\nInstead, what happens is that some people will see the actual April unemployment numbers as surprising new information to react to, while others will see it as old information in line with their expectations. Add in thousands of other pieces of information about which people have conflicting opinions, and it becomes pretty much impossible to know in advance if that information was all priced in appropriately.\n\nThe most recent comparable event is the subprime mortgage crash. Many people thought bottom was hit around November 2008 and there was a brief counter-trend rally before actual bottom was hit around March 2009. We don't know at this time if the market has bottomed out yet or not; nor do we know how long recovery could take.\n",

    "title": "How to determine how much to keep in a health savings account",
    "question": "We are a family of healthy people (30s/40s, kids in elementary/middle school). I've got an automatic contribution for my health savings account. The balance grows and grows. We've barely had a chance to spend any of it, aside from dental expenses.\n\nAre there guidelines about how much one should aim to set aside for medical expenses? Are there actuarial figures about what medical expenses are likely to be, over a given period? (Obviously any of us could come down with a horrible chronic disease at any time, and drain the account. The ultimate decision will be balancing risk and opportunity cost, but as it stands I don't have any information about the risk.)\n",
    "answer_id": "123514",
    "answer": "There are few different things to consider:\n\n\nDeductible : Since you have an HSA you are probably on a High Deductible insurance plan. Take a look at your HSA balance and divide by your max out of pocket deductible. That's the number of years you are covered for the \"worst case\" scenario. I'd say you want at least ten, but 100 years would be excessive. Depends of course on you own risk comfort.\nRetirement : health care cost will likely be the single largest expense in retirement and unfortunately it's the hardest to predict and find good data on. A recent fidelity study put the average life time out-of-pocket cost for a couple into the $300.000 range. Other studies quote about $5000-$7000 in today's dollar per year per person on Medicare. Health Care inflation is currently significantly higher than regular inflation, which complicates the math further. Still, it's not unreasonable to have several hundred thousand dollars squirreled away for retirement health care\nCoronavirus and shifts in the Health Care system: This is pure speculation at this point, but chances are that the current crisis will have an impact on the way Health Care works and gets paid for in the future. The most drastic change would be a single payer system (as many other countries in the civilized world already have) but it's very hard to predict how an HSA would roll over into this. One of the more plausible scenarios would be to allow a roll over into an IRA but that's all a wild guess at the moment. \nIn any case the current system is stretched thin already. The average retiree  spends more than  40% of their social security income on health care and it is getting worse quickly.\nInvestment: HSA contributions are pre-tax money. In most cases that alone will outweigh any potential investment return. Assuming there is no high interest debt, I would recommend to first max out pre-tax retirement contributions, then pre-tax college savings and then pre-tax HSA. If you have other highly attractive investment vehicle you can consider those too. Stocks are cheap at the moment, although very risky and likely to be volatile for a while.\n\n\nLooking at the actual medical risk is probably not that helpful. Statistics don't really help if it's just you and your family. Would you be doing anything differently if you knew the risk for a major health disaster is 0.1% instead of 0.2 % ?\n",

This does not guarantee that it will be better in the future, but it might indicate a better selection process (or could just be luck).\n\nThat said, you'd have to have a LOT of tracking error to make a significant difference between the two.

If your policy has such a discount, it may make sense to pre-pay the insurance instead.\n\nIf you do choose to make a lump sum payment on the car loan, it probably makes sense to actively communicate with your bank to make sure the payment is applied immediately to principal.

It's like trading 10 dimes for a dollar bill. The company is not worth any more or less after the fact. It used to be that a lower share price was desired since it would enable more investors that had to buy shares in 100-share lots. Nowadays, with index funds dominating the market, that benefit has largely gone away, which is why you see companies like Amazon and Apple decide not to split their shares that are worth hundreds or thousands of dollars per share. \n\nA reverse split may be required in order to stay listed on exchanges, but it often seen as a large negative signal, much like suspending a dividend. \n\nSo companies have no financial incentive to split or reverse split, but often have behavioral incentives not to reverse split.\n",

This offer was accepted.\n\nSince then, the coronavirus has broken out in the UK, and the markets have all dropped considerably (I was intending to put money saved in a Lifetime ISA toward the deposit- so this has obviously lost considerable value). Most things I've read are saying that we have no idea how long term the impact of the coronavirus will be on the financial markets, or whether it will impact the housing market in terms of house prices. Mortgage rates are already very low, so are unlikely to get any lower, particularly now that the Bank of England base rate has been dropped to 0.1%.\n\nI'm unsure what to do regarding the offer I have put in on the house. I am not buying for any reason other than owning my own home, and to establish that for myself and my family. I am fortunate that my job is relatively secure- even if there were to be a recession, and even if I were to lose my job, I have a trade to fall back on which is still in a growth industry in the UK. My experience to date has been that it generally takes me between 1-2 months to apply, interview for &amp; receive an offer for a job.\n\nSo, given that I am not looking at the house for any reason other than to establish a home (i.e. it is not primarily a financial investment), should I contact the vendors to reduce my offer, given all the uncertainty going on at the moment?\n\nIf so, how would it be best to approach this, and how much should I reduce my offer by?\nIf not, why not?\n\nAre there any other factors that I should be taking into consideration here?\nIf it makes a difference- there is no chain on the sellers' end, and I heard recently that they had also had an offer accepted, so was expecting to hear on completion dates relatively soon.\n",

It is perfectly fine to supplement an active portfolio by passive index funds, or to supplement an index fund portfolio with several carefully chosen stocks.\n\nWhat is bad advice is to buy lots of various active funds (leading to index returns, because there are so many of the active funds, without low costs of index investing). If you believe in active investing, you should select only a fund or at most two in the same market, having fund managers you can trust.\n\nWhat is also bad advice is to buy quasi-active funds, funds that claim to be active but don't really take any active risk because the fund manager fears losing to the index return. In this case, too, you pay for active management but get passive returns.\n\nLet me propose a case where you could supplement an index portfolio with some actively chosen stocks. If you, for example, like traveling a lot more than most people. Unfortunately, traveling uses oil, so it might be a good idea to buy stocks of oil companies. Traveling also requires aeroplanes, so it might be a good idea to buy aeroplane manufacturer stocks. You of course travel with an airline, so it might be a good idea to buy airliner stocks.\n\nOr, if you drive a lot with an electric car. In this case, it might be a good idea to supplement your index portfolio with stocks of Tesla and electric utility companies, especially those that produce electricity with fixed cost structure like hydropower or nuclear power.\n\nLet me also propose a case where you could supplement an active portfolio with some index funds: you run out of ideas. Simply said. You have so much money to invest but you can't find any companies where you would like to increase your ownership. In this case, it's perfectly fine to buy index funds.

Last week, the banks announced that they will doing a share buyback, and this week, the prices of the shares have increased...\n\nIs there any reason why the banks are buying their own shares at a crisis like this? \n",
    "answer_id": "122041",
    "answer": "Assume there is a corporation that makes spoons, with $10M in cash. Its single factory is already pumping out as many spoons as it can. There is also no need to open a new factory, because our market research team has determined that no one will buy the new spoons from the new factory. Our R&amp;D team doesn't know how to make anything but spoons.\n\nSo, what does the company do with the cash? It could (1) sit on it, and earn basically nothing. Or it could (2) invest it in something completely unrelated to the spoon business. Or, it could (3) send it back to the shareholders. Let's look at each option:\n\n(1) If the company just keeps the cash in the bank account, then it will earn basically no interest, and the investors who own shares in the corporation will be unhappy to get such little returns on corporate assets. If they wanted to have a low-risk cash portfolio, they would do that with their own money, they wouldn't want their spoon-making-investment to make that decision for them.\n\n(2) If the company invests in non-spoon related things, then perhaps it will get into trouble by making foolish business decisions. Buying a fork-making factory could lead to trouble - why what if our spoon scientists forget to make the tines, and just makes the whole thing rounded, based on what worked for them in spoon making?? Again, if a company steps outside of its area of expertise, it is deciding, on behalf of its shareholders, to diversify its portfolio. But the shareholders could make that decision themselves, and doesn't necessarily want the corporation to make this decision. Note that some companies do successfully diversify, but it is typically part of an overarching plan that makes sense together, or else it often fails.\n\n(3) If the company returns the cash to the shareholders they can decide for themselves what to do with the cash. Some will invest in low-risk things like government bonds or simple savings accounts earning minimal interest. Some will invest in competing spoon-makers, and some might invest in new fork-making ventures. But the decision on how to invest goes back to the individual shareholders.\n\nBuying back stock is just one way to get money back to shareholders. The other common way would be to pay out a dividend. In financial theory, there are basically 3 differences between a share buy-back and a dividend: (A) A buyback is optional, meaning only the shareholders looking to sell their shares, will have shares bought by the company; (B) A buyback happens relative to the current share price in the market, meaning that part of the decision to make a buyback could be based on whether the company believes itself to be undervalued; and (C) the tax implications are different [In general, most countries tax capital gains on selling your shares, at a lower rate than corporate dividends].\n\nSo, why would a bank do a share buyback right now? Probably because interest rates are at a historic low, meaning that the bank has a limited ability to invest its capital to earn what it feels are good returns. So instead, it is leaving the choice to its shareholders how to invest - and because the bank probably feels its shares are undervalued, it is preferential to do this instead of paying a dividend. For the shareholders who remain in the company, the increase in share price is an indication that the decision made by the bank was one that benefited them.\n\nQuick note on the political aspect hinted at here: The main reason it is contentious to do a share buy-back in times like this, is that a government could give a stimulus package to a business, with the goal of having that business invest in itself, hire workers, etc.; if instead of investing in itself it just pays out the cash to shareholders, the government has effectively 'bailed out' the relatively wealthy individuals who own shares, rather than the working class who they were attempting to get jobs for.\n",

    "title": "Better way to invest for a short time for a period of one year",
    "question": "I am having a rather confusing financial situation. A the moment, I am having around 1200 euros a month on savings. I have the emergency fund already set up. The only huge debt i have that i need to take care off is my car which I am planning to pay it off in july next year. CoVid19 situation does not hinder my job as its deemed necessary by my company and hence I will be having a steady cash flow. \n\nI am looking for a better investment scenario , as I would like to invest this money but would need to cash out the next year to pay the debt off for car. It is possible for me to risk the loss upto 20% of my total investment. I normally follow a value investment strategy and long term holding. I am also interested in REITs but in general in order to cash out from REIT, one must do that an year advance to liquidate and hence i believe this does not suit my situation.  So none of the strategies that I know are helpful here. Is there any specific investment that i can make during this year which gives me flexibility to invest my money ? \n\nI am not really satisfied in leaving the money in the bank account doing nothing as I live in Germany and the interest on savings accounts are  as low as zero and is not much helpful.\n",
    "answer_id": "122079",
    "answer": "If you can lose 20% and still make the balloon  payment then only risk the 20%. Based on your question you can set aside 1,200 a month for the next 15 months. Since 20% of 15 months is 3 months take the next three months payments and invest it in a ETF or mutual fund. The remaining 12 months keep it safe in a bank or CD.\n\nYou can do this because you already have an emergency fund, and you believe your job is secure. If you didn't have the emergency fund you would send the extra amount there. If you were worried about your job you wouldn't want to tie up money you might need soon. \n\nOf course if you can save interest by making the balloon payment early, I would wait until the last 3 months to invest, and make the balloon payment as soon as possible or even make a larger monthly payment.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "Banks are businesses, with the attendant differences in service offerings and internal cost structures. This alone accounts for differences in prices for essentially identical goods and services. After all, every accountant offers accounting services by definition, but not all of them charge the same amount.\n\nGoogling about for the bank LBC Digital at the top of your list, it turns out that this is Laurentian Bank (cool name, if I may say so, but no, it's not mine). According to a November 2019 review by Money We Have:\n\n\n  The best high interest savings accounts in Canada just got a new player as Laurentian Bank has just launched LBC Digital, an online bank that helps Canadians improve their financial health.\n\n\nOnline banks, like online shops, can have lower cost structures compared to their bricks-and-mortar peers. They may have fewer staff, less rental, and so on. If so, every dollar of profit after expenses needs somewhat less revenue support than peers with higher costs.\n\nWhen new entrants compete against incumbents, pricing is a popular mechanism with which to get customers. By giving more interest for an equivalent product, they'd probably hope that more people would choose to keep their money with them instead with other banks. More established players have other levers to pull. For example, if you've been getting exceptional service from one bank, you might be happy to forego some interest to continue getting that service. This might be monetary, such as low mortgage costs, or non-monetary, such as simpler access to credit approvals. Or you might just like to be able to walk in and have staff recognise you on sight because you've been banking at that branch for years.\n\nThe actual reasons aren't likely to be published, but there are enough other factors that equal insurance (e.g. CDIC) doesn't translate automatically to equal rates.\n",

    "question": "During Covid19 pandemic I managed to save some money and I was thinking about repaying some of my debts, however, I'm not sure should I do it, or keep cash just in case things turn for the worse. This is my situation with concerns against repaying each debt.\n\nI have roughly 7000 GBP\n\nI have three debts:\n\n\n6500 GBP overdraft (APR 35%)  \n2500 GBP PayPal credit (APR 19.9%) \n1600 GBP Amex credit card (APR 23.5%)\n\n\nI could repay my overdraft, it would save me around 150 GBP each month and I could still use it as if money would be in my bank account in case of a real emergency.\n\nI could repay both PayPal and Amex cards saving around 120 GBP each month and have some money left. My concern is that PayPal Credit and Amex are the least acceptable forms of payment in the UK and in case I would need access to money there is a chance I won't be able to use.\n\nI can just keep the cash and pay interest on all three accounts until crisis is over.\n\nWhat should i do?\n",
    "answer_id": "122124",
    "answer": "Keeping some liquid cash is sensible, but the exorbitant rates on your debt will hurt you long-term. Pay them off as quickly as safely possible.\n\nSince you have high-interest debt, getting rid of that debt is more important than maintaining a large emergency fund. Having both savings and overdraft fees is illogical. However, I understand that you'd rather have cash than paying of other debts if you expect to be laid off soon.\n\nTo save the most money, the optimal solution is to pay off the highest-interest debt first. Here, that is the overdraft.\n\nUnless you will also be able to pay off the other debts within a couple of months, it could be sensible to refinance. A small loan for £5000 at 6% over 12 months (~ £440/month) could give you breathing room to pay off all high-interest debts and stabilize your finances – if you are still eligible for such loans.\n\nAside from affecting job stability, the Covid-19 situation doesn't change a lot. If you've struggled to live without debt pre-Corona, it won't get easier now. That's why it could be helpful to pay off as much as possible now, so that you aren't saddled with endless interest payments in more difficult times: who knows how long this crisis will last? And you need to figure out why you have so much cash and so much debt, but that is out of scope here.\n",

    "wrong_answer": "Bear in mind that the credit score is generated by some secret formula that will never be disclosed to you.  Attempting to game it is rarely worth the effort, especially if you end up paying excessive amounts of interest in doing so.\n\nThe purpose of a credit score is simply to answer the question \"if this person borrows money from us, how likely are they to pay it back on time?\"\n\nSo the most important thing you should do is make payments on time.\n\n\n  I wasn't sure what to title this question. I am new to building my\n  credit score and using credit cards. I am hoping to clear up a few\n  questions I have. One is, if I purchase something on my credit card\n  and setup minimum monthly payments does that negatively affect my\n  credit score? If so, and if I setup payments that are higher than that\n  minimum monthly payment but less than paying in full every month does\n  that affect my credit score less than just making minimum payments?\n\n\nIf you pay the card off in full every month, that shows you pay your debts and have no money problems.  That's good.\n\nPaying only the minimum can lead to ever-increasing debt if you continue spending on the card.  Not only is that bad for you, as you are paying excessive amounts of interest every month, but if the debt gets too close to the credit limit, then it looks like you have money problems.  That's bad.\n\n\n  Are there any cards that will allow me to disburse a debt over a\n  period of time (with interest) without affecting my credit score? For\n  instance, lets say I want to purchase a $300 item from a store which\n  does not have a monthly payment feature to break that up; say for\n  instance, into 3 $100 payments over 3 months. Are there any credit\n  cards that will do that for me without it negatively impacting my\n  credit score?\n\n\nThat would be any credit card.  You can pay off as much as you like any month, so long as it's at least the minimum amount.  If you want to pay off a third of the debt every month, that's fine.\n",

Here's a link comparing performance during the crisis.\n\nRegarding what performs better than a 10-ish year treasury bond during a crisis, I'd say a longer treasury bond. There are maturities up to 30 years, and they did better during 2008 than shorter maturity bonds. However, those bonds expose you to significantly more fluctuations because of interest rate changes, so I'd avoid them unless you understand their risks.\n",
