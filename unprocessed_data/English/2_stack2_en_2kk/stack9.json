    "wrong_answer": "The health minister of France, Olivier Véran, recently left global health officials puzzled when he [warned that people](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/health/coronavirus-ibuprofen.html) ill with the coronavirus should stay away from painkillers like ibuprofen and aspirin. He said such nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, or Nsaids, could aggravate symptoms of the coronavirus, and suggested that people take acetaminophen instead.  Because the coronavirus is a new pathogen, there is not a lot known on how patients respond to common medications, but other experts pushed back on the French minister’s warning.  “It’s all anecdote, and fake news off the anecdotes,” said Dr. Garret FitzGerald, chair of the department of pharmacology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.  The World Health Organization has said that it is aware of no research showing that ibuprofen should not be taken by patients with Covid-19, and the F.D.A. said it was investigating the issue further and would provide more information when it becomes available."

On the state and local level, the laws vary depending on the region.  Still, the U.S. government doesn’t have the authority to impose a quarantine as sweeping as China, which confined some 70 million people in the largest effort in history. In the U.S., quarantines have been very rare. The last one was in the 1960s against a suspected smallpox outbreak. Health warnings are more common, like in 2016 when the C.D.C. advised pregnant women to avoid Southern Florida during an outbreak of the Zika virus."

When pumping gas, sanitize your hands after replacing the pump and before you touch the car door handle, steering wheel and any other part of the vehicle. If an attendant pumped the gas for you, sanitize your credit card after it is handed back to you.  Minimize bathroom breaks as much as possible. While this advice goes against AAA’s general advice to take a break every 100 miles, Mr. Sinclair said drivers could rest in vehicles at scenic overlooks or in parking lots of rest stops. Otherwise, wash your hands after using a public restroom and before touching your car.

But in the long term, moderation is important. Your body’s physical stress response may affect what kinds of foods you are reaching for, drawing you more toward carbohydrates and foods that are high in fat. Take stock of how any stress and anxiety may have affected your eating habits.  If you think you’re snacking too much when you’re not hungry, it may help to allow some time to pass and distract yourself with another activity before grabbing more food. Try to add some healthy snacks like fruits and vegetables into your routine, if you can.  If you’re regularly not eating enough, find something you can tolerate eating, or drink a calorie-rich beverage, like a protein shake. If you’re forgetting to eat entirely, schedule your mealtimes into your calendar and treat meals like any other essential appointment.

It expands jobless aid, providing an additional 13 weeks and a four-month enhancement of benefits, and extends the payments for the first time to freelancers and gig workers.  The measure would also offer $377 billion in federally guaranteed loans to small businesses and establish a $500 billion government lending program for distressed companies reeling from the impact of the crisis, including allowing the administration the ability to take equity stakes in airlines that received aid to help compensate taxpayers. It would also send $100 billion to hospitals on the front lines of the pandemic.",
    "wrong_answer": "__**Student loans** The Department of Education has granted a payment waiver of at least 60 days to many people. But it’s not necessarily automatic. In general, you have to call your loan servicer to request a waiver and to make sure that your loan is eligible. The waiver does not apply to private student loans. One big private lender, Sallie Mae, said it is offering suspension of payment for up to three months, with no damage to a borrower’s credit.  With the stimulus package, there will be [automatic payment suspensions for any student loan](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-stimulus- package-questions-answers.html) held by the federal government until Sept. 30. It may be hard to contact many of the loan servicers right now, so check your account online in the coming weeks.  **Utility bills** Some utility providers are offering to stop cutting people off for nonpayment. A number of large internet companies have agreed not to terminate residential or small-business customers who can’t pay their bills. Exact policies and requirements vary, though, so if you need help, you should call and ask.  **Housing** There’s also a good chance you can delay your mortgage payment if the outbreak has left you short of money. The Federal Housing Finance Agency has instructed mortgage servicers to allow borrowers whose mortgages are owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac to delay payments. If you rent, the best national resource we’ve found so far is the search-by-state function on [Justshelter.org](https://justshelter.org/community-resources/). This offers information on local organizations that can provide advice to renters in distress.  **Loans and credit** Many consumer lenders are offering affected customers help if they can’t make payments. The American Bankers Association has a list of lenders here, although the help they’re offering varies. Some say they will allow borrowers to skip payments; some are offering other accommodations."

States have set their own rules for eligibility and benefits, which are generally calculated as a percentage of your income over the past year, up to a certain maximum. Some states are more generous than others, but unemployment typically replaces about 45 percent of your lost income. Under the plan, eligible workers would get an extra $600 per week on top of their state benefit.  One important note: You might not have to lose your job to qualify.

Those plans relied on the ability to gather lawmakers in a safe place together, however — a hazard during a pandemic.  \"There's no serious effort to grapple with what could happen in the event of a major catastrophe,\" said Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who pushed for plans in the wake of Sept. 11. He said that a bill to allow remote voting during a national crisis, put forward by Senators Rob Portman and Richard Durbin, was \"a good start.\"  So far, congressional leaders have [resisted calls for remote voting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/coronavirus-congress- voting.html), calling it a bad precedent and saying they need to address the current crisis. They have instead looked for ways to practice social distancing within the Capitol. \"There's reason to be wary about a virtual Congress,\" Mr. Ornstein said, like ensuring cybersecurity and that Americans can still see and hear lawmakers at work.  But he added that House and Senate leaders, through legislation or rule changes, could create the capacity for remote voting only in the most extreme circumstances, such as when many members are incapacitated or transportation to the Capitol or an alternate meeting place becomes impossible.",

    "question": "How is coronavirus transmitted?",
    "answer": "COVID-19 is caused by a virus known as SARS CoV-2. We already have a number of other coronaviruses that circulate in the community and most of them cause common colds. Most of the available evidence indicates that coronavirus is spread via droplets, so if an infected person coughs or sneezes, and their secretions fall on you, you may be infected too. But the most common way of becoming infected is from touching contaminated surfaces. If an infected person coughs or sneezes into their hand, then touches a hard surface such as a doorknob or railing, and you touch that surface, you could also be infected. Some experts believe the virus may also be airborne, but the wider consensus is that it’s droplet-spread. That’s why it’s so important to wash your hands often, and try to avoid touching your face, because your hands can transmit the virus into orifices such as your nose, mouth or eyes.",
    "wrong_answer": "A COVID-19 vaccine is probably still at least a year away. The University of Queensland has developed a vaccine candidate, and it’s being tested on animals at the moment. Human clinical trials will follow in a few months if the vaccine looks like it’s going to be effective. But getting a vaccine to the market is a slow process, because health authorities have to be 100 per cent sure it’s safe. Even once a vaccine is shown to work and to be safe, scaling up production of the vaccine can take time, so it will probably be a year to 18 months before a vaccine will be available."

    "answer": "For most people, COVID-19 causes mild respiratory illness. Common symptoms are fever, shortness of breath and coughing. Some people also get a runny nose or muscle aches, although those are far less common. For some people, the disease can progress to pneumonia, and it usually gets worse in the second week. Estimates have varied, but the experience in China suggests the death rate may be about 1 per cent, although the WHO has put it slightly higher. But chances of dying depend significantly on age and state of health — the very young rarely seem to be affected at all, while the death rate in the elderly is much higher, about 15 per cent.

Most of the available evidence indicates that coronavirus is spread via droplets, so if an infected person coughs or sneezes, and their secretions fall on you, you may be infected too. But the most common way of becoming infected is from touching contaminated surfaces. If an infected person coughs or sneezes into their hand, then touches a hard surface such as a doorknob or railing, and you touch that surface, you could also be infected. Some experts believe the virus may also be airborne, but the wider consensus is that it’s droplet-spread. That’s why it’s so important to wash your hands often, and try to avoid touching your face, because your hands can transmit the virus into orifices such as your nose, mouth or eyes."

    "question": "Is there a cure?",
    "answer": "There’s no treatment for coronavirus. Some hospitals in China and in Queensland have used antiviral drugs to treat sufferers, and there are clinical trials into the effectiveness of antiviral treatments. But the care of patients is largely what’s known as supportive care, or making the patient comfortable: for example, giving Panadol to lower fever or giving oxygen if someone is struggling to breathe. In critical cases, a person would be placed on a heart-lung life-support machine in an intensive care unit, but most people who contract the virus don’t need to go to hospital and can recover at home in isolation.",
    "wrong_answer": "For most people, COVID-19 causes mild respiratory illness. Common symptoms are fever, shortness of breath and coughing. Some people also get a runny nose or muscle aches, although those are far less common. For some people, the disease can progress to pneumonia, and it usually gets worse in the second week. Estimates have varied, but the experience in China suggests the death rate may be about 1 per cent, although the WHO has put it slightly higher. But chances of dying depend significantly on age and state of health — the very young rarely seem to be affected at all, while the death rate in the elderly is much higher, about 15 per cent. People with comorbidities such as heart or lung conditions, or diabetes, have a higher risk of death."

    "answer": "A COVID-19 vaccine is probably still at least a year away. The University of Queensland has developed a vaccine candidate, and it’s being tested on animals at the moment. Human clinical trials will follow in a few months if the vaccine looks like it’s going to be effective. But getting a vaccine to the market is a slow process, because health authorities have to be 100 per cent sure it’s safe. Even once a vaccine is shown to work and to be safe, scaling up production of the vaccine can take time, so it will probably be a year to 18 months before a vaccine will be available.",

For example, the IRS requires married couples with both spouses under 65 to file returns for 2019 if their gross income was at least $24,400.

One of the most troubling rumors that often spreads alongside outbreaks is who exactly has the disease — something that can lead to racial and ethnic profiling.\nNirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said it is important to separate the disease from the person suffering from the disease. No ethnic group is more or less susceptible to the coronavirus.\n“My concern is that fear and misinformation will spread much faster than this virus will,” Shah said in an interview Wednesday.\nBottom line: If you hear what sounds like unrealistic information, check it out before you pass it around social media."

The vast majority of those cases, 78,064, are in mainland China, and most of those are in Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak.\nBut officials are increasingly worried about South Korea, where the number of cases has climbed from just a handful to more than 1,200 in the last week or so. An outbreak in Italy has infected 322 people, a worrying sign that the virus may be gaining a foothold in Europe. Seven other European nations confirmed new cases of the virus overnight. And an outbreak in Iran has infected more than 100 residents.\n“The sudden increases in cases in Italy, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Korea are deeply concerning,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday.\nThe Iranian outbreak has spawned new cases in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman; the Italian outbreak is now linked to cases in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Germany, Spain and Switzerland.\nTuesday marked a sobering moment for epidemiologists watching the virus: It was the first day that more new cases were confirmed in countries besides China than new cases in China itself, according to the WHO.\nThere have been 57 cases diagnosed in the United States, 36 of whom were repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Most of the rest of the cases have occurred in travelers who have recently returned from China. Just two people have been infected in the United States itself.",

    "answer": "We don’t entirely know yet. Of the 81,191 confirmed cases, 2,768 people have died, a mortality rate of about 3 percent. That would be worse than the Spanish Flu, which had a mortality rate of about 2 percent, and substantially worse than a more ordinary influenza, which kills between one in a thousand and one in ten thousand people.\nBut there are lots of unknowns.\nFirst, the bad news: Only about 30,000 people have recovered from the virus, which leaves 50,000 or so still in some stage of treatment. Not all of those people will recover, so the mortality rate is expected to rise at least a little bit.\nNow, the good news: That 81,191 figure represents only the number of confirmed cases. It appears likely that many thousands more were infected and either did not suffer symptoms or suffered symptoms too minor to seek treatment. In that case, the mortality rate is probably substantially lower than the statistics make it seem.",

Coronaviruses are not uncommon — you’ve almost certainly had several during your lifetime, and at worst you might have called in sick with a common cold. And even if you contract this particular coronavirus, you may show few if any signs.\nBut if your health is poor already — especially your respiratory system — this virus is more troubling. Many of those who have succumbed have been older, and young children may be particularly susceptible as well. Those who become ill will have problems in their upper respiratory tract; those who become severely ill will have problems in the lower respiratory tract, and those can lead to really serious health concerns like pneumonia and bronchitis.",
    "wrong_answer": "At the moment, the federal government is doing a lot of warning. The CDC has produced two dozen guidance documents for hospitals, instructions for preparedness and infection control. Crucially, they are offering guidance on preserving personal protection equipment — like masks and gloves — in a recognition that a widespread outbreak is likely to impact already-low supplies.\nThe Trump administration has created a task force to oversee the response, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. But the administration has not named a coordinator to oversee a whole-of-government response, similar to what the Obama administration did during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\nIn other words, there is no one person whose full-time job is to oversee the government’s response.\nPresident TrumpDonald John TrumpWaPo: Trump allegedly asked Fauci if officials could let coronavirus 'wash over' US Kansas Supreme Court upholds order banning religious services of over 10 people Biden wins Alaska primary MORE plans to hold a press conference on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. ET alongside members of his coronavirus task force. His administration has requested $2.5 billion in emergency funding, but even Republicans have been skeptical that that’s enough to handle a widespread outbreak. Senate Democrats on Wednesday said they would seek $8.5 billion in funding.\nOn a state level, hospitals and public health officials are preparing for a growing number of cases. State health directors happen to be in Washington this week for an annual meeting, and many spent Wednesday walking the halls of Congress, lobbying their members to support funding.\nAt home, those officials are working to make sure their hospitals have the capacity they need to handle an outbreak — enough beds, enough equipment and protective gear, enough laboratory capacity to test samples they take from potentially infected victims, and enough people to run the tests.\n“We’re starting to work with hospitals and EMS systems initially to make sure that they have all the capacity that they need,” Shah said of Maine’s preparations. “The public should appreciate that hospitals are used to taking care of sick people. That is what they do.”\nWhat are the broader risks, beyond the virus?\nWe’ve already seen the virus’s impact in China, where factories and stores closed for days or weeks and cities have been quarantined to stop its spread. Other countries may follow China’s lead. Frieden said the outbreak is likely to cost at least $100 billion to combat globally — and maybe ten times as much, if things spiral out of control.\nBut as in other outbreaks, the fallout is going to extend beyond immediate health concerns. When Ebola broke out in West Africa, more people died from other, treatable diseases — malaria, cholera, even HIV — because the health systems shut down.\nIn this case, China is a major source of the generic drugs used in the United States, for everything from hypertension to diabetes. The virus is likely to impact supply chains, making scarce drugs that are completely unrelated to the coronavirus. Experts recommend keeping a three-month supply of any prescription drugs you take on hand in case of that disruption.\n“The Chinese manufacturing issue will affect us,” says Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Preparedness at the University of Minnesota. “We’ll have a major shortfall between what will be needed and what will be available.”\nPersonal protective equipment, like masks and gloves, are already in short supply after a particularly bad flu season. Manufacturers are rushing to fill the gaps, but that takes time, and global demand is growing.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services said it has a stockpile of about 30 million masks, but says it needs 300 million to protect front-line health care workers. Those workers, who treat patients, would be most at risk of contracting the virus; more than 3,000 health care workers have been infected in China already.\nThe broader economic impact is also unknown, though Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said in a note to investors Wednesday that the odds of a recession in the first half of the year now stand at 40 percent, twice what he predicted a few months ago.\n“If it is a pandemic, if it does show up in Europe and the United States, then that is the prescription for a global and U.S. recession,” he said.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 are both off more than 6 percent in the last two days, the worst two-day drop in years.\nThere is a decent chance that major sporting events and public gatherings will be delayed or canceled. A major trade show, the Mobile World Congress, has already been canceled in Barcelona, Spain. Soccer games have been canceled in Italy, and political demonstrations are temporarily banned in Seoul, South Korea.\nThe organizers of the Tokyo Olympics, set for later this year, have insisted the games will go on. But a former top International Olympic Committee official, Dick Pound, cast doubt on those plans on Tuesday, saying the organizers had about a three-month window in which to decide to pull the plug.\nThe last time the Olympics were canceled was in 1944, when games scheduled for Italy and London were scrapped because of World War II."

    "answer": "The CDC says the symptoms are similar to those of a common cold. A patient might develop a fever, a cough, and shortness of breath. At the moment, it appears someone who is infected can show symptoms as early as two days later and as long as 14 days after they have been infected, based on past coronavirus outbreaks like MERS and SARS.",
    "wrong_answer": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported at least 81,191 cases of the virus as of Wednesday morning. The vast majority of those cases, 78,064, are in mainland China, and most of those are in Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak.\nBut officials are increasingly worried about South Korea, where the number of cases has climbed from just a handful to more than 1,200 in the last week or so. An outbreak in Italy has infected 322 people, a worrying sign that the virus may be gaining a foothold in Europe. Seven other European nations confirmed new cases of the virus overnight. And an outbreak in Iran has infected more than 100 residents.\n“The sudden increases in cases in Italy, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Korea are deeply concerning,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday.\nThe Iranian outbreak has spawned new cases in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman; the Italian outbreak is now linked to cases in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Germany, Spain and Switzerland.\nTuesday marked a sobering moment for epidemiologists watching the virus: It was the first day that more new cases were confirmed in countries besides China than new cases in China itself, according to the WHO.\nThere have been 57 cases diagnosed in the United States, 36 of whom were repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Most of the rest of the cases have occurred in travelers who have recently returned from China. Just two people have been infected in the United States itself."

    "question": "How easy is it to catch the coronavirus?",
    "answer": "Tom Frieden, who directed the CDC for eight years during the Obama administration, says it’s too early to know exactly how transmissible the virus is, how long it lives on surfaces or how many people who get the disease become really sick.\n“There’s still a lot we don’t know about this infection. We don’t know how readily it spreads, we don’t know, really, what proportion of people get severely ill,” he told The Hill.\nBut what we do know is that the virus spreads from person to person through air droplets, much like an influenza. That makes it dissimilar from something more deadly, like Ebola, which spreads only when someone comes into contact with another person’s bodily fluids. There are signs, too, that the coronavirus can transmit even before someone shows symptoms, which is going to cause problems for health officials trying to contain its spread.\nNow is a good opportunity to remind ourselves the lessons we teach toddlers: Wash your hands a lot. Cough or sneeze into your elbow. Stay at home if you’re sick. Those little steps end up having big, positive consequences.\nAnyone who comes into contact with someone infected with the virus should notify their health care provider, the CDC says. Older people and young children, especially those with underlying health concerns, are at the most risk.",
    "wrong_answer": "Coronaviruses are a relatively broad family of viruses named for the spikes that come out of a virus particle. Under a microscope, they look like a crown, or a halo — like the sun’s corona.\nThe current coronavirus first emerged from Wuhan, in China’s Hubei Province, most likely from a fish and animal market where humans routinely come into direct contact with animals. The virus probably jumped from an animal — we still don’t know for sure what species — to a human, a process of interspecies transmission called zoonosis.\nThe virus itself is called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2. The disease caused by the virus is called coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19."

    "answer": "Public health officials are increasingly worried about misinformation that seems to accompany every outbreak, fueled by social media and inflammatory rhetoric.\nIf you hear a rumor about the virus, check it out with reputable sources — the CDC, state health agencies and the WHO all have websites with the most up-to-date information about the virus and its spread.\nIncreasingly, those agencies also have fact-checking sections on their websites, aimed at combating misinformation. One of the most troubling rumors that often spreads alongside outbreaks is who exactly has the disease — something that can lead to racial and ethnic profiling.\nNirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said it is important to separate the disease from the person suffering from the disease. No ethnic group is more or less susceptible to the coronavirus.\n“My concern is that fear and misinformation will spread much faster than this virus will,” Shah said in an interview Wednesday.\nBottom line: If you hear what sounds like unrealistic information, check it out before you pass it around social media.",
    "wrong_answer": "The coronavirus relief bill is not yet law, and the IRS has yet to provide information about how it plans to implement the provision about the rebates. On the IRS’s coronavirus landing page, the agency is telling people not to call it right now and to check back for updates at a later point.\n\nTax experts are hoping that the IRS issues guidance to clarify issues about eligibility when taxpayers’ situations differ in 2018, 2019 and 2020, as well as guidance about which nonfilers now need to submit a tax return in order to receive a payment."

    "question": "What is the U.S. government doing to combat the virus?",
    "answer": "At the moment, the federal government is doing a lot of warning. The CDC has produced two dozen guidance documents for hospitals, instructions for preparedness and infection control. Crucially, they are offering guidance on preserving personal protection equipment — like masks and gloves — in a recognition that a widespread outbreak is likely to impact already-low supplies.\nThe Trump administration has created a task force to oversee the response, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. But the administration has not named a coordinator to oversee a whole-of-government response, similar to what the Obama administration did during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\nIn other words, there is no one person whose full-time job is to oversee the government’s response.\nPresident TrumpDonald John TrumpWaPo: Trump allegedly asked Fauci if officials could let coronavirus 'wash over' US Kansas Supreme Court upholds order banning religious services of over 10 people Biden wins Alaska primary MORE plans to hold a press conference on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. ET alongside members of his coronavirus task force. His administration has requested $2.5 billion in emergency funding, but even Republicans have been skeptical that that’s enough to handle a widespread outbreak. Senate Democrats on Wednesday said they would seek $8.5 billion in funding.\nOn a state level, hospitals and public health officials are preparing for a growing number of cases. State health directors happen to be in Washington this week for an annual meeting, and many spent Wednesday walking the halls of Congress, lobbying their members to support funding.\nAt home, those officials are working to make sure their hospitals have the capacity they need to handle an outbreak — enough beds, enough equipment and protective gear, enough laboratory capacity to test samples they take from potentially infected victims, and enough people to run the tests.\n“We’re starting to work with hospitals and EMS systems initially to make sure that they have all the capacity that they need,” Shah said of Maine’s preparations. “The public should appreciate that hospitals are used to taking care of sick people. That is what they do.”\nWhat are the broader risks, beyond the virus?\nWe’ve already seen the virus’s impact in China, where factories and stores closed for days or weeks and cities have been quarantined to stop its spread. Other countries may follow China’s lead. Frieden said the outbreak is likely to cost at least $100 billion to combat globally — and maybe ten times as much, if things spiral out of control.\nBut as in other outbreaks, the fallout is going to extend beyond immediate health concerns. When Ebola broke out in West Africa, more people died from other, treatable diseases — malaria, cholera, even HIV — because the health systems shut down.\nIn this case, China is a major source of the generic drugs used in the United States, for everything from hypertension to diabetes. The virus is likely to impact supply chains, making scarce drugs that are completely unrelated to the coronavirus. Experts recommend keeping a three-month supply of any prescription drugs you take on hand in case of that disruption.\n“The Chinese manufacturing issue will affect us,” says Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Preparedness at the University of Minnesota. “We’ll have a major shortfall between what will be needed and what will be available.”\nPersonal protective equipment, like masks and gloves, are already in short supply after a particularly bad flu season.

For example, the IRS requires married couples with both spouses under 65 to file returns for 2019 if their gross income was at least $24,400.

    "wrong_answer": "Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing."

    "answer": "Is it safe to visit hospitals? Yes, it is safe to go to hospitals as Covid-19 patients are kept in separate isolation wards. The Covid-19 virus does not spread very far. If you have Covid-19 patients isolated in one area of the hospital then the virus won't reach the other area. Nonetheless, hospitals are crowded during flu season, so try postponing your visit to the OPD for routine checkups.",
    "wrong_answer": "Can a person cured of Covid-19, get infected again? This is a viral infection. Like swine flu or H1N1, if you are exposed to it, you can get infected again. But once you get the infection, the human system develops antibodies to fight the virus which is why in case you contract the infection again it is likely to be less severe than before. So, if after getting cured for Covid-19, you end up getting infected again, you might have milder symptoms."

    "answer": "Will summer or humidity kill Covid-19? Chances are it won't. It might reduce the transmissibility of the virus due to extreme heat. But we have seen tropical countries like Singapore report a good number of cases despite humidity. Plus during summers, people generally spend more time indoors and in air-conditioned spaces, where the temperature is low. This can instead spread the virus. Since we still don't know how this pandemic will play out in India, practicing social distancing is the best option.",

    "question": "How likely am I to catch COVID-19?",
    "answer": "The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19. COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It's important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go.",
    "wrong_answer": "Will it go away in the summer?\nFlu fades each spring and the new virus may do the same, Fauci said last week in a podcast with a journal editor. \"I am hoping that as we get into the warmer weather we will see a decline that will give us a chance to get our preparedness up to speed,\" Fauci said. But that, too, is far from certain. \"We have to assume that the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread, and it's a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza,\" said Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization's emergencies chief. Flu viruses also mutate quickly, requiring new vaccines to be made each year. If the coronavirus follows suit, Frieden said, \"It could become a virus that circulates around the world for many years to come.\""

Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment). If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with a simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others.

The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.

    "question": "What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?",
    "answer": "You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:\n\n 1: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.\n\n 2: Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.\n\n 3: Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.\n\n 4: Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.\n\n 5: Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.\n\n 6: Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places - especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.",

    "answer": "Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing.",
    "wrong_answer": "Will summer or humidity kill Covid-19? Chances are it won't. It might reduce the transmissibility of the virus due to extreme heat. But we have seen tropical countries like Singapore report a good number of cases despite humidity. Plus during summers, people generally spend more time indoors and in air-conditioned spaces, where the temperature is low. This can instead spread the virus. Since we still don't know how this pandemic will play out in India, practicing social distancing is the best option."

    "answer": "Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask.",
    "wrong_answer": "Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed. To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products."

    "answer": "The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.",
    "wrong_answer": "Will it go away in the summer?\nFlu fades each spring and the new virus may do the same, Fauci said last week in a podcast with a journal editor. \"I am hoping that as we get into the warmer weather we will see a decline that will give us a chance to get our preparedness up to speed,\" Fauci said. But that, too, is far from certain. \"We have to assume that the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread, and it's a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza,\" said Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization's emergencies chief. Flu viruses also mutate quickly, requiring new vaccines to be made each year. If the coronavirus follows suit, Frieden said, \"It could become a virus that circulates around the world for many years to come.\""

    "question": "Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?",
    "answer": "No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different. SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.",
    "wrong_answer": "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don't develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention."

    "wrong_answer": "You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:\n\n 1: Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.\n\n 2: Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.\n\n 3: Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.\n\n 4: Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.\n\n 5: Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.\n\n 6: Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places - especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas."

In a report last week on the first 12 patients in the US, seven were hospitalized; most had underlying health problems and got worse during the second week of illness. In China, slightly more males have been diagnosed with COVID-19 than females, which might be because roughly half of Chinese men smoke but only 5% of females do, Frieden said.

    "question": "Will it go away in the summer?",
    "answer": "Will it go away in the summer?\nFlu fades each spring and the new virus may do the same, Fauci said last week in a podcast with a journal editor. \"I am hoping that as we get into the warmer weather we will see a decline that will give us a chance to get our preparedness up to speed,\" Fauci said. But that, too, is far from certain. \"We have to assume that the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread, and it's a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza,\" said Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization's emergencies chief.

    "answer": "What's the test like?\nThe CDC recommends at least two swabs -- nose and throat. Samples are sent to labs that look for bits of viral genetic material, which takes roughly 4 to 6 hours. Altogether, it can take several days to ship a sample and get results back. It's been taking two to three days, and \"we are working really hard to see if we can shorten that time\" by developing an in-house test, Dr. Aimee Moulin of the University of California, Davis said Thursday in a conference call held by the American College of Emergency Physicians. Some areas have opened drive-thru sites for testing, which could reduce exposure to health workers and other patients or the public.",
    "wrong_answer": "No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different.

    "question": "How it spreads",
    "answer": "How it spreads\nMost spread is from droplets produced when an infected person coughs, which are inhaled by people nearby. Transmission from touching contaminated surfaces hasn't been shown yet, though recent tests by US scientists suggest it's possible -- one reason they recommend washing your hands and not touching your face. The virus can live in the air for several hours, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. Cleaning surfaces with solutions containing diluted bleach should kill it. \"While we are still learning about the biology of this virus, it does not appear that there is a major risk of spread through sweat,\" said Julie Fischer, a Georgetown University microbiologist. The biggest concern about going to the gym is infected people coughing on others, or contaminating shared surfaces or equipment, she said. Consider avoiding large classes and peak hours and don't go if you're coughing or feverish, she suggests. The risk of virus transmission from food servers is the same risk as transmission from other infected people, but \"one of the concerns in that food servers, like others facing stark choices about insurance and paychecks, may be pressured to work even if they are sick,\" she said.",

    "question": "Can infected people who recover get it again?",
    "answer": "Can infected people who recover get it again?\nIt's not known. A few reports from China say some people had COVID-19, recovered and then fell ill again. It's unclear if that's a relapse, a new infection, or a case where the person never fully recovered in the first place. Scientists at the at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle say the 30,000-letter genetic code of the virus changes by one letter every 15 days. It's not known how many of these changes would be needed for the virus to seem different enough to the immune system of someone who had a previous version of it for it to cause a fresh infection. Fauci told Congress on Thursday that it was unlikely that someone could get reinfected. \"We haven't formally proved it, but it is strongly likely that that's the case,\" he said. \"Because if this acts like any other virus, once you recover, you won't get reinfected.\"",

    "question": "When is the virus most contagious?",
    "answer": "When is the virus most contagious?\nThe average time from exposure to developing symptoms is five to six days, but can be up to two weeks. Tests have found high amounts of virus in the throats and noses of people a couple days before they show symptoms. Signs of virus also have been found in stool weeks after patients recover, but that doesn't mean it's capable of causing illness, scientists warn. \"The virus can be degraded,\" said Robert Webster, a St. Jude Children's Research Center virus expert. \"It's not necessarily infectious virus at all.\"",
    "wrong_answer": "Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing."

The 69-year-old man in Wuhan had both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. Doctors initially diagnosed the man with the flu and later diagnosed the coronavirus.\r\n\r\nDoctors studying the patient said the case \"suggests that COVID-19 might be underdiagnosed because of false-negative tests for upper respiratory specimens or co-infection with other respiratory viruses. Broader viral testing might be needed.\"\r\n\r\nPeter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, agrees.\r\n\r\n\"I don’t like that people are doing flu tests and saying therefore it’s not coronavirus,\" Hotez said. \"Traditionally, for flu, we know it’s possible to get other co-infectious with other viruses.\"",

But coronavirus tests in the U.S. aren't being done this way.",
    "wrong_answer": "Depending on the type of surface, the virus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days, according to the WHO. A recent study by scientists in the U.S. found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. \n\nHowever, a subsequent report from the CDC found that genetic material from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks. The CDC found traces of the virus' RNA, not the coronavirus itself, on surfaces in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship – 17 days after passengers had left the cabins.\n\nIt's possible that you can become infected if you touch your face after touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, according to the CDC. But scientists don't think surfaces are the main way that the virus spreads; the most common form of infection is from respiratory droplets spread by a person's cough or sneeze, the CDC reports.\n\nMeanwhile, the WHO says it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, traveled and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. That means the virus cannot spread through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting coronavirus cases.\n\nAt the same time, the WHO is reportedly encouraging people to use as many digital payment options as possible. Viruses can survive on hard surfaces like coins for days in some cases. U.S dollars, a blend of fabric and paper, are harder for viruses to stick to."

The highest risk of serious illness and death is in people older than 80 years,\" Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters in a recent telebriefing.\r\n\r\nThe CDC recommends that people over 60 stock up on supplies, keep away from others who are sick, limit close contact, wash hands often, avoid crowds as much as possible, avoid cruises and don't fly on planes unless absolutely necessary.",

    "answer": "Of the more than 586,000 people who have been infected worldwide, more than 26,000 have died. That's a death rate of about 4.6%. The WHO has previously estimated the rate at about 3.4%.\r\n\r\nThe death rate, however, varies widely based on age, health and geographic location. People who are older or who have preexisting conditions are at higher risk of severe illness.",
    "wrong_answer": "\"It’s not the main mode of transmission. There's probably some component ofairborne, but I don’t think secondhand smoke would be a compounding factor,\"said Tania Elliott, clinical instructor of infectious diseases at NYU Langone.If the smoke irritates your lungs and causes you to cough, that poses agreater risk of transmission since the virus is thought to mainly spreadthrough respiratory droplets when someone coughs or sneezes, Elliot said.Smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 as the act of smokingmeans that fingers and possibly dirty cigarettes are in contact with lips,[according to the WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-on-smoking-and-covid-19). Smokers may also already have lung disease or reducedlung capacity which would greatly increase risk of serious illness, the WHOsays.While data is still evolving about how long the virus may remain alive, [arecent study](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/18/heres-how-long-coronavirus-can-live-surfaces-and-air-study/2863287001/) found thatviable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air."

    "answer": "Scientists aren't sure yet. For many viruses, including the MERS virus, patients are unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover because a protective antibody is generated in those who are infected. But scientists still need to do more research to determine if this is also the case with COVID-19 and how long those antibodies may last.\r\n\r\n\"However, in certain individuals, the antibody cannot last that long. For many patients who have been cured, there is a likelihood of relapse,\" said Li QinGyuan, director of pneumonia prevention and treatment at China Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing.\r\n\r\nPoland agreed, saying the chance of reinfection is \"very likely.\"",

    "question": "My primary income is from rentals. If my tenants are unable to pay their rent, what kind of relief is available to me?",
    "answer": "Trump in March signed [the largest economic stimuluspackage](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/27/coronavirus-house-set-pass-stimulus-package-includes-checks/2923953001/) in U.S. history.The [stimulus provides forbearance on mortgagepayments](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/03/31/coronavirus-what-happens-if-you-cant-pay-rent-due-pandemic/5099013002/) for up to a year butjust for federally-backed loans. Some states and banks are also issuing relieffor other types of mortgages. Once forbearance ends, borrowers would have towork out a repayment plan or loan modification with the mortgage servicer, theNational Housing Law Project says.Still, several states are granting moratoriums to renters but not owners,potentially forcing owners to pay their mortgage, utilities, taxes and othercosts even though they have less rental income.",

However, we do know thatsomeone infected with the virus may begin showing symptoms anywhere betweenone and 14 days after catching the virus, most commonly around five days,[according to the WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses).\"The peak viral shedding occurs during the first five days after the onset ofsymptoms. My guess is that within a few days of being exposed, these patientsare beginning to shed virus,\" Poland said.A recent report from the CDC studying an outbreak at a care home in WashingtonState found that among 23 residents who tested positive for the virus, 13 wereasymptomatic. Within a week, 10 of those 13 developed symptoms, with onset at3 days."

And if youare still unemployed after state benefits end, you could get an additional 13weeks of help.",
    "wrong_answer": "Depending on the type of surface, the virus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days, according to the WHO. A recent study by scientists in the U.S. found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. \r\n\r\nHowever, a subsequent report from the CDC found that genetic material from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks. The CDC found traces of the virus' RNA, not the coronavirus itself, on surfaces in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship – 17 days after passengers had left the cabins.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that you can become infected if you touch your face after touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, according to the CDC. But scientists don't think surfaces are the main way that the virus spreads; the most common form of infection is from respiratory droplets spread by a person's cough or sneeze, the CDC reports.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the WHO says it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, traveled and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. That means the virus cannot spread through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting coronavirus cases.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the WHO is reportedly encouraging people to use as many digital payment options as possible. Viruses can survive on hard surfaces like coins for days in some cases. U.S dollars, a blend of fabric and paper, are harder for viruses to stick to."

    "question": "I was told I should be tested if I could not easily inhale a large breath and hold it for at least 10 seconds. Is this good advice?",
    "answer": "No. While shortness of breath is among the most common symptoms of the virus,according to the CDC, that diagnosis does not necessarily involve holding alarge breath for 10 seconds. Medically known as dyspnea, shortness of breathis often described as \"an intense tightening in the chest, air hunger,difficulty breathing, breathlessness or a feeling of suffocation,\" accordingto the Mayo Clinic.If you think you may be sick, call your doctor and [follow CDCguidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html).",

    "answer": "The longer a mask is used and the more damp it becomes, the less effective itis, Poland said. \"But it is definitely better than the alternative of nomask!\"",
    "wrong_answer": "Of the more than 586,000 people who have been infected worldwide, more than 26,000 have died. That's a death rate of about 4.6%. The WHO has previously estimated the rate at about 3.4%.\n\nThe death rate, however, varies widely based on age, health and geographic location. People who are older or who have preexisting conditions are at higher risk of severe illness."

    "question": "If a person tests positive for influenza, they are not tested for coronavirus. Could a person have both?",
    "answer": "Yes, a person could have both. This was the case for one patient in China, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 69-year-old man in Wuhan had both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. Doctors initially diagnosed the man with the flu and later diagnosed the coronavirus.\n\nDoctors studying the patient said the case \"suggests that COVID-19 might be underdiagnosed because of false-negative tests for upper respiratory specimens or co-infection with other respiratory viruses. Broader viral testing might be needed.\"\n\nPeter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, agrees.\n\n\"I don’t like that people are doing flu tests and saying therefore it’s not coronavirus,\" Hotez said. \"Traditionally, for flu, we know it’s possible to get other co-infectious with other viruses.\"",
    "wrong_answer": "Scientists aren't sure yet. For many viruses, including the MERS virus, patients are unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover because a protective antibody is generated in those who are infected. But scientists still need to do more research to determine if this is also the case with COVID-19 and how long those antibodies may last.\n\n\"However, in certain individuals, the antibody cannot last that long. For many patients who have been cured, there is a likelihood of relapse,\" said Li QinGyuan, director of pneumonia prevention and treatment at China Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing.\n\nPoland agreed, saying the chance of reinfection is \"very likely.\""

    "question": "Can testing show if someone has had coronavirus and then recovered?",
    "answer": "Yes, but it depends on what kind of test you do. \"If you do an antibody test, in theory it could show that you had the virus and then recovered,\" Hotez said.\n\nTo do an antibody test, you'd need to have blood drawn. But coronavirus tests in the U.S. aren't being done this way.",
    "wrong_answer": "Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilusinfluenzae type B vaccine, do not provide protection against the newcoronavirus, [according to the World HealthOrganization](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters). The vaccines simply guardagainst those specific bacterial infections.The COVID-19 virus can, in fact, cause pneumonia, but the vaccines cannotprevent this pneumonia."

    "question": "Is it best to cancel routine doctor and dental appointments?",
    "answer": "Federal health officials are asking Americans to stay home as much as possible and cancel any elective surgeries. Some local and state governments have implemented stricter rules.\n\nIf it's possible to keep your appointment and speak with your provider over the phone or video, you should. However, if you cannot speak with a provider remotely and are able to reschedule your in-person appointment for a later date, you should.",

    "question": "What is involved in testing for the coronavirus? Is it the same as when they do a nasal swab for influenza?",
    "answer": "To collect a sample for a diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, doctors typically use the same method of collection as they would for influenza: a nasopharyngeal swab. For this swab, a tiny Q-tip on plastic or a wire stem is put up your nose about 3 or 4 inches.\n\n\"I've had it done, and it's mildly uncomfortable for a few seconds,\" said Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group.\n\nA doctor may also do a throat swab. In some cases, if you have a \"wet\" cough, a doctor may also have you cough up some phlegm into a collection cup. These specimen are then packed with ice and shipped to a lab for testing.\n\nTo determine if someone has recovered from the coronavirus, at least two different nasal swabs taken at least 24 hours apart must test negative, Poland said.",
    "wrong_answer": "A study of more than 72,000 cases in mainland China found that at least one person between ten and 19 years of age had died, but no one younger than ten had died. A subsequent study in the journal Pediatrics found that a 14-year-old boy from China died in February after contracting the coronavirus.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if anyone younger had died elsewhere in the world.\n\nBy comparison, at least 155 children in the U.S. have died after contracting the flu so far this flu season, according to the CDC."

    "question": "Should people in their 60s be concerned? Are they considered elderly?",
    "answer": "As with seasonal flu, people at highest risk for severe disease and death include people over the age of 60 and those with underlying conditions, according to the World Health Organization.\n\n\"Starting at age 60, there is an increasing risk of disease and the risk increases with age. The highest risk of serious illness and death is in people older than 80 years,\" Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters in a recent telebriefing.\n\nThe CDC recommends that people over 60 stock up on supplies, keep away from others who are sick, limit close contact, wash hands often, avoid crowds as much as possible, avoid cruises and don't fly on planes unless absolutely necessary.",
    "wrong_answer": "If you have symptoms and want to get tested, the CDC recommends calling your state or local health department or a medical provider.\r\n\r\nNot sure if you should get tested? The CDC website features a \"self-checker\" to help you make decisions about seeking medical care. The feature is not intended for the diagnosis or treatment of COVID-19 and is intended only for people in the U.S."
