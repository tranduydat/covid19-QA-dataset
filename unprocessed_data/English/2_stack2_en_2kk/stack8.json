    "question": "How can we limit the spread of the coronavirus?",
    "answer": "There are lots of things that everyone can do to help limit the spread of the coronavirus.\nNHS advice says:\nRegularly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds\nWhen you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve (not your hands!)\nTry to avoid close contact with people who are unwell\nAs Dr Xand explained, people should stay at home if they're feeling poorly, especially if they have a temperature, a cough, or are feeling achy.\nThe WHO says keeping at least two metres apart from someone who might be coughing or sneezing will help stop the coronavirus spreading.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said people should stay at home to help stop the spread of the virus. He has closed all sorts of places where people gather, such as shops, libraries, cinemas and places of worship, to persuade them to do this.",
    "wrong_answer": "If you get coronavirus it takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, scientists have said, but some people will get symptoms much later than this.\n\"So we don't know that information for everyone, but it seems to be like a few weeks on average, something like that,\" Dr Xand said.\n\"People can be very ill for a few weeks and then they gradually get better,\" he added.\nThe UK government has said it wants everybody to stop going outside if they can to stop the virus spreading.\nBut it especially wants people to self-isolate if they have symptoms.\nAs virus expert, Dr Jake Dunning, explained, it basically means staying at home so the virus can't spread to other people.\nIt also means other people can't come round to visit you while you're self-isolating.\nAccording to medical experts, 99% of people will make a full recovery, as their immune system eventually defeats the virus."

    "question": "What is the current policy on birthing partners?",
    "answer": "Expectant mothers should be encouraged to have a birth partner with them during labour and birth, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says, unless the partner is showing symptoms of coronavirus.\n\nAs local trusts may place restrictions on visitors, partners may not be able to go to antenatal appointments, or stay with women on antenatal or postnatal wards. But this doesn't mean they cannot attend the birth, as long as they feel well.\n\nSome NHS trusts will allow only one birth partner to be in attendance, where previously they had allowed two. There were reports that others had banned partners' attendance altogether, before doing a U-turn on official advice.\n\nUnderstandably, some pregnant women feel nervous about going into a hospital in case it increases their risk of catching the coronavirus.\n\nMaternity units are carrying out some consultations over the phone or via video link, but some in-person visits with the midwife are essential for the wellbeing of the mother and baby, the Royal College of Midwives says.\n\nIt adds that home births may no longer be available in some local areas, mainly due to staff and ambulance shortages, but maternity wards are being kept as separate from Covid-19 treatment areas as possible.",
    "wrong_answer": "This is highly unlikely to happen, according to scientists and vets.\nThere have been no cases of pets passing the coronavirus to humans, and the same was true during the Sars outbreak in 2003, when there was not a single case of pet-to-human transmission.\nSars is a very closely-related virus to the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.\nIt is possible that a pet's fur could become contaminated if an infected person has previously touched or stroked the animal.\nAs always, you should wash your hands with soap and water after handling an animal or its lead, and avoid touching your nose and mouth.\nThe novel coronavirus is thought to have originated in wildlife and passed to humans via a live animal market, but it is likely the first people infected actually ate infected meat. Since then it has been spread from person to person.\nHowever, a Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo recently tested positive for the virus. She was thought to have been infected by an asymptomatic zookeeper, so there is evidence of human-to-animal transmission."

    "answer": "There's a lot of focus on the individual checks, but I'm firmly of the mind the small business loan piece of this is far and away the most important given what's happening right now.\n\nThe bill directs $350 billion for loans to small businesses and nonprofits with under 500 employees. The loans would be guaranteed by the Small Business Administration but the actual lender would be approved banks and financial institutions, which should get the money out the door faster. Businesses could receive up to $10 million in loans to float employee salaries, payroll expenses, mortgage and other debt payments. If used for those purposes, the loans would be forgiven in the future. It's a huge deal if it works properly.\n\nThere are several other small business related provisions in here that may be useful and/or valuable to those who are eligible. Be sure to check them out to see if you may qualify -- a key component of this package is expanding eligibility for government programs (see: the unemployment insurance expansion/enhancement).",

Use a tissue to hold onto a pole. Avoid touching your face while you’re riding, and use hand sanitizer if you have it while you’re commuting. \n Again, wash your hands before, during and after your trip. \n New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recommends letting crowded trains or buses pass and waiting for a less crowded one. It’s nearly impossible to maintain 6 feet of distance on a packed subway car. \n If you have a chronic illness, find alternative means of transportation — being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection."

However, we don’t have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point,” the CDC says. \n “The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.”\n President Donald Trump suggested this coronavirus could subside by the warmer summer months, but scientists say it’s too early to tell. And the fact that coronavirus keeps spreading in the Southern Hemisphere during its summer months suggests this strain might not succumb to warmer temperatures. \n “The short answer is that while we may expect modest declines in the contagiousness of (novel coronavirus) in warmer, wetter weather and perhaps with the closing of schools … it is not reasonable to expect these declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent,” wrote Dr. Marc Lipsitch, director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard’s T.H.

    "answer": "The CDC recently changed its guidance on wearing face masks as more studies about asymptomatic spread pile up.\n Now, the CDC “recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies).”\n But there are several important caveats and key points: \n \n The public should NOT buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks. Those are desperately needed by health care workers who are in close contact with coronavirus patients every day. \n Instead, make your own cloth mask — it’s easy, and you don’t have to sew. US Surgeon General Jerome Adams shows how to make face masks with just a T-shirt and rubber bands in this CDC video. You can also use a bandana and a coffee filter. \n Don’t be fooled: The main benefit of wearing masks in public isn’t to protect you from getting sick. Rather, it’s to protect others from yourself if you’re sick or you’re an asymptomatic carrier. “This is more for people who might be infected and don’t know it, and to try and lower the likelihood that they will spread this to somebody else,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. The CDC agreed.\n You can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask. The virus can stay alive on surfaces for up to 3 days, and it’s easy to touch your face whenever you’re not wearing a mask. Also, people often adjust face masks frequently, leading to more touching of the face — a common way that coronavirus spreads.\n It’s important to wash your cloth mask after every use. Here’s how. \n Wearing cloth masks is just “an additional, voluntary public health measure,” the CDC said. To protect yourself from getting coronavirus, it’s critical to stay 6 feet away from others, wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds each time, and stop touching your face.",

And it can seriously mess them up, like it messed me up,” Mitchell said. \n He started feeling sick on St. Patrick’s Day, with just a small cough. “I thought at first it was just a normal cold. And then it started progressively getting worse,” he said. \n “Four days in, the really bad symptoms started coming along. I started having really bad outbreaks, like sweating, and my eyes were really watery. I was getting warmer and warmer, and I was super fatigued. … I would start experiencing the worst headaches I’ve ever felt in my life. They were absolutely horrible.”\n Eventually, the teen had to be hospitalized. His mother said she worried he might “fall asleep and never wake up.” \n Mitchell is now recovering, but still has a cough almost a month later. \n “I just hope everybody’s responsible, because it’s nothing to joke about,” he said. “It’s a real problem, and I want everybody to make sure they’re following social distancing guidelines and the group limits.

    "answer": "Many health care workers don’t actually have enough protective gear to handle the growing influx of coronavirus patients. \n Some have resorted to using plastic report covers as masks. The CDC said medical providers might have to use expired masks or reuse them between multiple patients. (This shortage is why the general public should not buy medical masks and instead make cloth masks at home.)\n But it’s not just subpar protective gear that puts medical workers at risk. It’s also the amount of virus they’re exposed to. \n “The viral load — the amount of virus – does determine the severity of your illness,” emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen said. “So that could happen in the case of health care workers who are exposed to a lot more Covid-19 as a result of their work — that they get more severely ill.”",

Luckily, transit systems are upping their cleaning regimens — notably the New York subway system. \n Dr. Robyn Gershon, a professor of epidemiology at New York University’s School of Public Health, has some tips: When you ride a bus or subway, sneeze or cough into your elbow. Use a tissue to hold onto a pole. Avoid touching your face while you’re riding, and use hand sanitizer if you have it while you’re commuting. \n Again, wash your hands before, during and after your trip. \n New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recommends letting crowded trains or buses pass and waiting for a less crowded one. It’s nearly impossible to maintain 6 feet of distance on a packed subway car. \n If you have a chronic illness, find alternative means of transportation — being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection.",

    "question": "After recovering from coronavirus, does a person have long-term immunity to the virus?",
    "answer": "It’s too early to know for sure. But other coronaviruses, like ones that cause the common cold, might give us clues. \n With “common cold coronaviruses, you don’t actually have immunity that lasts for very long, and so we don’t know the answer with this specific coronavirus,” said Dr. Celine Gounder, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the New York University School of Medicine.\n “That’s actually going to be one of the challenges with designing a vaccine is how do you actually cause the immunity to last long enough to protect you.”",
    "wrong_answer": "No. Those products work on surfaces but can be dangerous to your body. \n There are some chemical disinfectants, including bleach, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform, that may kill the virus on surfaces. \n But if the virus is already in your body, putting those substances on your skin or under your nose won’t kill it, the World Health Organization says. Not to mention, those chemicals can harm you. \n And please – do not ingest chemical disinfectants."

    "question": "Since a plane's cabin keeps circulating air, will I get sick if another passenger is sick?",
    "answer": "Most viruses don’t spread easily on airplanes because of how the air circulates and is filtered, the CDC says. \n Modern commercial jets recirculate 10-50% of the air in the cabin, mixed with outside air. \n “The recirculated air passes through a series of filters 20-30 times per hour,” the CDC says. \n “Furthermore, air generally circulates in defined areas within the aircraft, thus limiting the radius of distribution of pathogens spread by small-particle aerosols. As a result, the cabin air environment is not conducive to the spread of most infectious diseases.”\n Still, try to avoid contact with anyone sneezing or coughing. And if you’re feeling sick, cover your entire mouth and nose with the inside of your elbow when you cough or sneeze.",
    "wrong_answer": "You can’t, said Dr. James Phillips, chief of disaster and operational medicine at George Washington University Hospital.\n “We’re so far behind on testing, there’s only one way we can be certain not to transmit the virus and be certain not to get it ourselves: We need to start treating every person as though they have this, ” Phillips said. \n “And everyone needs to treat us like we have it, and socially distance ourselves in that manner. Because until we have (enough) testing, we don’t know who has this. And we’re not sure when they start spreading it.” \n That’s why it’s so critical to avoid crowds, stay at least 6 feet away from others, wash or disinfect your hands, and stop touching your face."

But now, many hospitals are “absolutely full,” Schaffner said. “We have under-built hospital beds because they are very expensive.”\n Also, Americans have grown accustomed to “just-in-time” ordering. But that becomes a huge problem when international supply chains are disrupted by an outbreak. “We didn’t anticipate international turbulence influencing this,” Schaffner said.\n Now, some health care workers are making their own masks.

    "answer": "Coronavirus isn’t just infecting young people. It’s killing young, healthy people as well. \n We’ve reported many stories about young people getting severely sick with or dying from coronavirus. \n Dimitri Mitchell, 18, admits he had a “false sense of security.” But he was later hospitalized with coronavirus and now wants everyone to take it seriously. \n “I just want to make sure everybody knows that no matter what their age is, it can seriously affect them. And it can seriously mess them up, like it messed me up,” Mitchell said. \n He started feeling sick on St. Patrick’s Day, with just a small cough. “I thought at first it was just a normal cold. And then it started progressively getting worse,” he said. \n “Four days in, the really bad symptoms started coming along. I started having really bad outbreaks, like sweating, and my eyes were really watery. I was getting warmer and warmer, and I was super fatigued. … I would start experiencing the worst headaches I’ve ever felt in my life. They were absolutely horrible.”\n Eventually, the teen had to be hospitalized. His mother said she worried he might “fall asleep and never wake up.” \n Mitchell is now recovering, but still has a cough almost a month later. \n “I just hope everybody’s responsible, because it’s nothing to joke about,” he said. “It’s a real problem, and I want everybody to make sure they’re following social distancing guidelines and the group limits. And just listen to all the rules and precautions and stay up to date with the news and make sure they’re informed.”",

The original version of the book called the strain the “Gorki-400,” in reference to a Russian locality, before it was later changed to the “Wuhan-400.” In the book, the virus was man-made, while scientists believe the novel coronavirus started in animals and jumped to humans.

This happened because the Trump administration refused to allocate money to a program that started during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. \n Former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden warned that move “would significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world.”\n Problems with the testing Malfunctions, shortages and delays in availability have all contributed to the slowdown. \n In the first few weeks of the outbreak in the US, the CDC was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results — even though a World Health Organization test became available around the same time. \n Some test kits that were sent around the country were flawed — a move that put the US behind about “four to five weeks,” says Dr. Rob Davidson, executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare.",
    "wrong_answer": "If you can, you should stay home from work when you’re sick, whether or not you have coronavirus. \n Many companies are increasingly flexible with work from home policies. If your company is allowing employees to work from home, consider it. Some companies have enforced working from home. \n If you must go into work, maintain 6 feet of distance from your colleagues, wash your hands frequently and practice good respiratory etiquette by coughing or sneezing into your elbow.\n Avoid handshakes, switch in-person meetings to teleconferences and disinfect your workspace with EPA-approved products at the start of your shift."

    "answer": "No, antibiotics are not effective against coronavirus because the disease is a viral infection, not a bacterial infection. \n “However, if you are hospitalized for the [coronavirus], you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible,” the World Health Organization says. \n There is no known cure for the coronavirus. Researchers are studying whether the antiviral drug remdesivir might work, but testing of that drug just started.\n For now, coronavirus patients get “supportive” treatment, “which means giving fluids, medicine to reduce fever, and, in severe cases, supplemental oxygen,” the Harvard Medical School says.",

    "answer": "COVID-19 has caused widespread destruction around the world, with even\ndeveloped nations including Italy, France and Spain reporting thousands of\ndeaths and completely overwhelmed health-care systems.\n\nThe situation was rapidly deteriorating into something similar in the U.S. by\nMarch 31, with New York City's iconic Central Park [turning into a makeshift\nhospital](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/scenes-from-the-epicentre-\ngrim-images-from-new-york-city-1.4874424) and experts predicting [82,000\ndeaths](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/82-000-people-could-die-in-\nu-s-from-coronavirus-by-august-model-cited-by-white-house-1.4875601) even in a\nbest-case scenario.\n\nCanada has thus far avoided the worst of the outbreak, but experts are unable\nto say whether that will continue – in fact, they're [unable to offer any\ncredible forecasts at all](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/when-\nwill-canada-pass-the-peak-of-covid-19-even-the-experts-don-t-know-1.4869852).\n\nProjecting the spread of the virus through Canada at this point is nearly\nimpossible because of several factors, including uncertainty over how many\nCanadians have actually been infected, unknowns around whether Canadians are\nfollowing public health recommendations well enough to curb COVID-19's spread,\nand the lag time between when an infection occurs and when it is reflected in\nthe data.\n\n\"We don't exactly know where we are on the epidemic curve, and we don't\nexactly know where we were when we started having our strong public health\nresponse,\" Dr. Ashleigh Tuite, an expert in modelling the spread of infectious\ndiseases, told CTVNews.ca on March 26.",

    "question": "How did it start?",
    "answer": "The virus is one of the few that can be transmitted from animals to humans. It is believed to have originated in bats, which perhaps infected live animals and seafood sold at a \"wet market\" in Wuhan, a crowded, not so sanitary dense marketplace. Bats are also hosts for Ebola, HIV, and rabies.\r\n\r\nThe first person who contracted the virus on December 1, 2019, had no connection to the outdoor market, making it unclear how he contracted it in the first place. \r\n\r\nOthers who shopped there came down with viral pneumonia from Covid-19.",
    "wrong_answer": "Yep. If you use the PPP loan for one of the purposes listed above for the eight weeks following the inception of the loan, it is forgiven. In the added guidance given by the SBA yesterday, they mention that “it is anticipated that not more than 25% of the forgiven amount may be for non-payroll costs.” For the PPP, you’ll need to apply for forgiveness with your lender that is servicing your loan.\nSimilarly, the $10,000 advance (which should be coming to those of you that applied on Monday pretty soon) is not required to be repaid, even if you’re denied additional funds. It’s a little ambiguous to me whether you’re required to use the funds to pay the above expenses (it says “may”). Currently, I'm relying on the interpretation of the US Chamber of Commerce. We will learn more as additional guidance comes out and the grants start getting disbursed, which will be soon."

    "question": "What exactly does it mean to flatten the curve?",
    "answer": "Flattening the curve refers to the rate at which people are getting infected. Without intervention, the number of individuals who contract Covid-19 rises exponentially, which means it doubles at a constant rate — in this case, every three days. At such a rate, the number of infected individuals will overwhelm our hospital system, because we simply don't have enough hospital beds and respirators to treat them all. The United States doesn't even have enough protective equipment at present to protect its own health care workers. \n\nDoing the math, if one person is infected with the virus on Jan 1, with the number of people infected people doubling every 3 days, then by March 31, over 1 billion people will have become infected. With the world population being around 7.8 billion, it would only take until April 9 for all of us to be infected.\n\nThe situation in Italy has shown us that, without enough equipment, hospitals will be compelled to turn away some of the most infirmed among us, resulting in increased fatalities.  \r\n\r\nStaying home does not prevent you from contracting the virus down the line, but from contracting the virus and overwhelming the medical establishment now. Postponing exposure buys time for the scientific and medical community to develop effective treatments or a vaccine to minimize or protect against infection.",

    "answer": "Tests are limited and most state and local health authorities will tell you not to get tested, even if you have symptoms, unless:\r\n\r\nYou have symptoms and were recently in contact with someone who tested positive for Coronavirus.\r\nYou have symptoms and need to be hospitalized.\r\nCotton swabs and tests are in short supply, so if you do not fall into the above two categories, chances are your doctor will not order a test.  \r\n\r\nStill, if you have symptoms, call your medical doctor to be advised on how to proceed.

    "wrong_answer": "This was the most commonly asked question. The CARES Act not only provides relief for small business owners through loans but also allows the self-employed, independent contractors and part-time workers to collect unemployment benefits.\nThat initially seemed like double dipping to me. But as a colleague in the Twitterverse pointed out, it could make sense if your unemployment is covering personal expenses while your EIDL and/or PPP is covering other operating expenses. For example, if you are a restaurant owner, you have to pay for a mortgage, paid leave and supply chain disruptions, while we all wait out stay-at-home orders. But you also have to buy groceries and pay your home utility bills. If you can only get a loan to cover business expenses, you may still need unemployment benefits to pay your personal expenses.\nKeep in mind, the details for unemployment benefits — eligibility rules, benefit amounts, length of payments, etc. — vary from state to state. In Illinois, for instance, to maintain your eligibility for unemployment, you must be able to work, you have to be available to accept a job and you have to be looking for work. If the additional loan funds allow you to keep running your business, it may be hard to demonstrate that you’re out of work.\nI’ve already heard from a few self-employed people who have applied for unemployment—and had widely varying results. Most likely the rules will become clearer in time, as the states decide what will and won’t be allowed."

    "question": "Can I get an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) and a Paycheck Protection Program Loan (PPP)?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can get both loans, but the key is to use the money to cover different expenses. Section 1102(a)(2)(G), the section outlining the PPP loans, explains the borrower requirements. It says the borrower has to certify that “the eligible recipient has not received amounts under this subsection for the same purpose and duplicative amounts.”\nAs a reminder, EIDLs can be used to cover:\n\nPaid sick leave to employees unable to work due to the direct effect of COVID-19. Maintain payroll Increased costs due to supply chain disruption Rent or mortgage payments Repaying obligations that cannot be met due to revenue loss\n\nPPP loan funds can be used to cover:\n\nPayroll costs Group health care benefits during periods of paid, sick, medical, or family leave, and insurance premiums. Interest on a mortgage obligation Rent, under lease agreements in force before February 15, 2020 Utilities, for which service began before February 15, 2020 Interest on any debt incurred before February 15, 2020\n\nSo, if you’re getting an EIDL to cover payroll expenses, you can’t get a PPP to cover payroll for the length of the forgiveness period (eight weeks from when the loan is due). You would have to use the EIDL for different operating expenses or payroll for a different period. This will also go for other state or local assistance.\nThat being said, you don’t have to have both. If you’ve already gotten an EIDL for payroll purposes but just want the PPP loan, you can refinance the loan into a PPP. Any amount that was given to you as a grant under the EIDL will reduce the amount forgiven under PPP.",

    "question": "I work by myself and pay contractors. Do I still have payroll?",
    "answer": "Many sole proprietors or independent contractors have wondered what counts as payroll, if they don’t have any employees. Section 1102(a)(2)(A)(viii)(bb) expands the definition of payroll costs to include “the sum of payments of any compensation to or income of a sole proprietor or independent contractor that is a wage, commission, income, net earnings from self-employment or similar compensation that is not more than $100,000.”\nIn its most recent guidance, the SBA clarified that while income of sole proprietors and independent contractors count as payroll, payments to independent contractors do not count: “independent contractors have the ability to apply for a PPP loan on their own so they do not count for purposes of a borrower’s PPP loan calculation.”\nPayroll also includes payment of compensation to employees for:\n\nSalary, wages, commission (not to exceed $100,000) Cash tips or equivalent Vacation, parental, family, medical or sick leave Severance or separation pay and any retirement benefit Group health care benefit pay including insurance premiums State and local tax on the compensation of employees",

    "question": "What is this eight-week formula everyone keeps talking about?",
    "answer": "This is the formula to figure out if your loan forgiveness under PPP will be reduced. I like the US. Chamber of Commerce illustration for figuring this out. You take your payroll costs and multiply them by a fraction. The top half of the fraction has the average number of full-time equivalent employees (FTE) per month for the eight weeks beginning on loan origination. The bottom half has either the average number of FTEs per month from February 15, 2019 to June 30, 2019 OR the average number of FTEs per month from January 1, 2020 to February 29, 2020.

    "question": "Is it REALLY all forgiven, if used appropriately?",
    "answer": "Yep. If you use the PPP loan for one of the purposes listed above for the eight weeks following the inception of the loan, it is forgiven. In the added guidance given by the SBA yesterday, they mention that “it is anticipated that not more than 25% of the forgiven amount may be for non-payroll costs.” For the PPP, you’ll need to apply for forgiveness with your lender that is servicing your loan.\nSimilarly, the $10,000 advance (which should be coming to those of you that applied on Monday pretty soon) is not required to be repaid, even if you’re denied additional funds. It’s a little ambiguous to me whether you’re required to use the funds to pay the above expenses (it says “may”). Currently, I'm relying on the interpretation of the US Chamber of Commerce. We will learn more as additional guidance comes out and the grants start getting disbursed, which will be soon.",

    "question": "What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?",
    "answer": "Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news. \n\n\n \nYou can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:\n\n\n \nRegularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. \n\n\n\nMaintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. \n\n\n\nAvoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick. \n\n\n\nMake sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. \n\n\n\nStay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. \n\n\n \nCalling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. \n\n\n \nKeep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.",

These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.

    "answer": "The infection period for the virus will vary from person to person. Mild symptoms in an otherwise healthy individual may resolve over just a few days. Similar to influenza, for an individual with other ongoing health issues, such as a respiratory condition, recovery may take weeks and in severe cases could be potentially fatal.",
    "wrong_answer": "Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19."

    "answer": "The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating.",

If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.\n\nWHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks.\n\nThe most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing."

    "answer": "No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.",
    "wrong_answer": "The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings."

    "answer": "Sure. Well, we do have a preliminary snapshot of cases in the U.S. from the CDC. And the picture so far is similar to what was documented in China. Coronavirus hits oldest people - older people the hardest. The CDC analysis found that about half of the people who've ended up in intensive care are 65 and older; the highest percentage of deaths in the U.S. has been among those 85 and older. Now this is based on an analysis of about 500 patients admitted to the hospital in the U.S. - so not all of the cases. But here's something to be aware of - younger adults can be vulnerable too; about 20% of people hospitalized were in their 40s and 50s. And this may come as a surprise - about 20% were younger. So some millennials and Gen Xers have gotten seriously ill.",
    "wrong_answer": "With new research that suggests the new coronavirus can live on surfaces for hours or days, the prospect of going grocery shopping can seem daunting.\nBut you can manage the risk.\nFirst of all, the viability of the virus goes down over time and it's sensitive to temperature – so it dies off more quickly in room temperature than it does in the cold.\nSecond, when you go to a grocery store, people aren't generally touching all the cans on the shelf — although there tends to be more handling of individual items in the produce section.\nAmong the things you can do to protect yourself and others are:\nKo says it helps to understand the differing levels of risk in different situations. Coming into close contact with a person who is infected with coronavirus carries greater risk than touching a shopping cart that might have been touched by an infected person hours or days earlier.\nWhen it comes to disinfecting things, it makes sense to focus on high-touch surfaces. Ko says you should worry more about disinfecting bathroom doorknobs and faucets at home than about a can of tomato soup from the supermarket.\n\"There's never anything that has zero risk,\" Ko says, \"but the risk is so much lower than [surfaces] that are more frequently touched.\""

But obviously it's important to see what the studies find.",

Kaiser Permanente has another design, as well as a video showing how to make a mask using a sewing machine. Both recommend 100% woven cotton fabric. Kaiser recommends washing and drying the fabric two or three times before cutting it, so it doesn't shrink later.\nYou can make a mask out of a T-shirt, no sewing machine required. You could also try making one out of (unused) shop towels.

But for now, they're saying patients who have recovered from an infection are not likely to be re-infected shortly afterwards.",
    "wrong_answer": "It probably can — but you shouldn't be overly worried. Here's why.\nSo far, there aren't scientific findings on how long the virus can live on fabric. But fabrics are generally porous — as is cardboard, which has been tested. And a recent study did find that the virus can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours.\n\"The thing that you have to consider, though, is that those tests are done in ideal testing circumstances,\" says Rachel Graham, a virologist at the University of North Carolina. \"That's like in some kind of hermetically sealed box where there's no fluctuation in humidity, there's no wind, there's nothing that can contribute toward desiccating the virus. And so desiccation — or drying out the virus — would actually reduce the amount of time it's actually viable on any kind of surface.\"\nPlus, porousness is a good thing when it comes to avoiding viral transmission. A surface that is permeable, like a fabric, tends to trap viruses more easily than hard surfaces.\n\"It's less at risk of transmitting because the virus gets kind of stuck to the [porous] surface, and so it can't be easily transferred back off of it,\" Graham says. \"Porous surfaces also suck the fluid out of it. The viral membrane is a lipid membrane, and so if that becomes dried out, it's basically done, infectivity-wise.\"\nIf you are concerned that clothing or other fabric items might have picked up the virus, throw the clothing in the washer and dryer. For most situations, says Graham, your detergent will do its job and get rid of any infective particles — or at least sanitize them to the point where they're not a risk to you.\nIf you're taking care of someone who is ill or immunocompromised or if you're working in a health care setting, you may want to take additional precautions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommendations for households with suspected or confirmed cases of the coronavirus, which include wearing gloves when handling dirty laundry from an ill person and using the warmest appropriate water setting when washing clothes or linens to disinfect them.\nI like to use wipes to disinfect surfaces in my home — especially surfaces that are frequently touched. But how much surface area can one wipe be used on before it loses its ability to kill the coronavirus?\nThe first step is to check the label on the wipes you're using. For instance, the label on a container of Clorox wipes instructs: \"Use enough wipes for treated surface to remain visibly wet for 4 minutes. To kill viruses, let stand 15 seconds.\"\nThat time and that visible wetness are important, says Erica Hartmann, an expert in environmental microbiology at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering.\nRegardless of the particular ingredients in the wipes you're using, \"they're all chemicals that have to react,\" she says. \"And those chemical reactions aren't instantaneous — they take a certain amount of time. So what you're doing when you're keeping the surface wet is you're basically allowing time, allowing the chemical reactions to take place.\"\nSo if that Clorox wipe isn't making the surface visibly wet for 4 minutes, you're trying to cover too much ground with one wipe.\nThere's no exact figure for how much surface area a wipe can handle. But a 2018 study found that one wipe is generally more effective over 1 to 2 square feet than 8 square feet.\nAnd you don't need a premade wipe to clean surfaces: You can also use a liquid product on a cloth or paper towel. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises using products that contain bleach (sodium hypochlorite) or alcohol (at least 70%) and following the manufacturer's directions. You can make your own cleaning solution by mixing 4 teaspoons of bleach per quart of water, according to the CDC.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has posted a list of approved products to disinfect against the coronavirus.\nStrangers keep petting my dog when we go for a walk. Could my dog transmit the virus on its fur?\nSaskia Popescu, an infection prevention epidemiologist at the health care system HonorHealth, says she's not especially concerned about dog fur transmitting the virus. \"I think that I would probably be more worried if somebody was coughing all over the place and went to touch my dog's harness or something — something inanimate,\" she says. \"I would put it in the lower-risk category.\"\nThat's because like fabric, fur is a porous surface — so it isn't easy for a person to pick up bits of virus from it. \"The chances of you getting it from fur and hair is going to be less than getting it from a solid surface,\" says Graham, the virologist. Still, she said, she would err on the side of caution and ask people not to pet your dog right now.\nGraham says one way to make sure your dog doesn't get touched by overenthusiastic petters is to avoid letting your dog off leash in a place where it may encounter other people. Rather than going to a dog park, she says, \"it might be a better idea to take your dog out in the yard or somewhere you know that there's not going to be a lot of people.\"\nAnd despite the occasional media report of a dog diagnosed with COVID-19, there is no evidence that pets can contract or spread COVID-19. The CDC says it has not received any reports of pets or animals becoming sick with the disease. The American Veterinary Medical Association concurs: \"Infectious disease experts and multiple international and domestic human and animal health organizations agree there is no evidence at this point to indicate that pets become ill with COVID-19 or that they spread it to other animals, including people.\"\nOne note: If you are already sick with COVID-19, the association recommends limiting contact with animals \"out of an abundance of caution\" until more is known about the virus. If you're not sick with the coronavirus, the group says you can interact with your pet as you normally would — while practicing good hygiene, including washing your hands before and after interacting with your pet."

And what Anthony Fauci, the top adviser, has said over the weekend is that the social distancing, all the measures we're taking - they will have an effect. But we just can't quantify the effect yet. I mean, how much we may be slowing the spread here is masked by the significant increase in cases each day, as you just mentioned at the top.\n\nSo you know, as testing expands, we're going to get this increase in cases. Hard to see the progress here - it's likely going to be much, much longer before life feels like normal again, right? I mean, many schools have extended closures. There'll be lots of distance learning going on. Many scientists and public health experts watching China as the country lifts its restrictions. Does the virus stay under control, or does it start to spread again? We can learn a lot by watching what happens there.",
    "wrong_answer": "Last week, the U.K. government signaled that it might be considering a different approach to coronavirus control than the rest of the world — in essence, allowing a large percentage of the population to become infected in order to develop a \"herd immunity\" that would eventually end the epidemic.\nHerd immunity occurs when enough people in a population are immune to disease — either because they've been infected and recovered or they've been vaccinated against it. The idea is that the pool of people who can catch the disease has been reduced, reducing the risk to the so-far unaffected.\nSir Patrick Vallance, the U.K. government's chief scientific adviser, said that about 60% of the population would need to get the coronavirus in order to get a herd immunity effect.\nBut using such an approach would raise a big question: During that spread, how do you protect the most vulnerable groups – the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions?\nHerd immunity works with contagious diseases like measles, for which a vaccine exists. But the idea that the U.K. would not immediately work to suppress the number of cases, especially as there are no approved treatments for COVID-19 yet and the disease has killed thousands in Italy, stirred an immediate public backlash.\nThe government quickly backtracked, and on Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said all restaurants, pubs and gyms would close for the foreseeable future to reduce transmission.\nAnd there is no certainty that herd immunity would even work for coronavirus. That approach \"assumes that people being infected are immune and cannot get re-infected. And we don't know that as of yet,\" says Albert Ko, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Yale School of Public Health.\nPeople who go outside to exercise are sometimes shamed on TV and on social media for risky behavior. Is it okay to go outside for a walk, run or bike ride?\nThe White House coronavirus guidelines for the 15-day period that started Monday advise avoiding \"discretionary travel, shopping trips and social visits,\" as well as \"social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people.\" But outdoor exercise is not on the list.\nSo unless local guidelines instruct otherwise, fresh air and outdoor exercise are allowed – though it's important to keep some distance between yourself and others. The coronavirus is thought to spread primarily through close contact between people – within about six feet.\nThe primary mode of transmission is through respiratory droplets.\nThere is better airflow outside than in confined spaces. That air flow outside reduces the risk of one person transmitting the virus to another through droplets in the air, says Albert Ko, the Yale epidemiologist. \"So if you're going out and you're hiking or biking or running and you're not within, say, six feet or 10 feet of another person, I would consider that a healthy, safe practice.\"\nKo also points to the significant mental health issues that can be caused or exacerbated when people are cooped up.\n\"My personal feeling is that if people are practicing sound respiratory hygiene, sound hand hygiene, they're distancing themselves physically from others outside, and you're exercising and walking in the park — I think that's actually a good public health practice.\""

And a recent study did find that the virus can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours.\n\"The thing that you have to consider, though, is that those tests are done in ideal testing circumstances,\" says Rachel Graham, a virologist at the University of North Carolina. \"That's like in some kind of hermetically sealed box where there's no fluctuation in humidity, there's no wind, there's nothing that can contribute toward desiccating the virus. And so desiccation — or drying out the virus — would actually reduce the amount of time it's actually viable on any kind of surface.\"\nPlus, porousness is a good thing when it comes to avoiding viral transmission. A surface that is permeable, like a fabric, tends to trap viruses more easily than hard surfaces.\n\"It's less at risk of transmitting because the virus gets kind of stuck to the [porous] surface, and so it can't be easily transferred back off of it,\" Graham says. \"Porous surfaces also suck the fluid out of it. The viral membrane is a lipid membrane, and so if that becomes dried out, it's basically done, infectivity-wise.\"\nIf you are concerned that clothing or other fabric items might have picked up the virus, throw the clothing in the washer and dryer. For most situations, says Graham, your detergent will do its job and get rid of any infective particles — or at least sanitize them to the point where they're not a risk to you.\nIf you're taking care of someone who is ill or immunocompromised or if you're working in a health care setting, you may want to take additional precautions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommendations for households with suspected or confirmed cases of the coronavirus, which include wearing gloves when handling dirty laundry from an ill person and using the warmest appropriate water setting when washing clothes or linens to disinfect them.\nI like to use wipes to disinfect surfaces in my home — especially surfaces that are frequently touched. But how much surface area can one wipe be used on before it loses its ability to kill the coronavirus?\nThe first step is to check the label on the wipes you're using. For instance, the label on a container of Clorox wipes instructs: \"Use enough wipes for treated surface to remain visibly wet for 4 minutes. To kill viruses, let stand 15 seconds.\"\nThat time and that visible wetness are important, says Erica Hartmann, an expert in environmental microbiology at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering.\nRegardless of the particular ingredients in the wipes you're using, \"they're all chemicals that have to react,\" she says. \"And those chemical reactions aren't instantaneous — they take a certain amount of time. So what you're doing when you're keeping the surface wet is you're basically allowing time, allowing the chemical reactions to take place.\"\nSo if that Clorox wipe isn't making the surface visibly wet for 4 minutes, you're trying to cover too much ground with one wipe.\nThere's no exact figure for how much surface area a wipe can handle. But a 2018 study found that one wipe is generally more effective over 1 to 2 square feet than 8 square feet.\nAnd you don't need a premade wipe to clean surfaces: You can also use a liquid product on a cloth or paper towel. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises using products that contain bleach (sodium hypochlorite) or alcohol (at least 70%) and following the manufacturer's directions. You can make your own cleaning solution by mixing 4 teaspoons of bleach per quart of water, according to the CDC.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has posted a list of approved products to disinfect against the coronavirus.\nStrangers keep petting my dog when we go for a walk. Could my dog transmit the virus on its fur?\nSaskia Popescu, an infection prevention epidemiologist at the health care system HonorHealth, says she's not especially concerned about dog fur transmitting the virus. \"I think that I would probably be more worried if somebody was coughing all over the place and went to touch my dog's harness or something — something inanimate,\" she says. \"I would put it in the lower-risk category.\"\nThat's because like fabric, fur is a porous surface — so it isn't easy for a person to pick up bits of virus from it. \"The chances of you getting it from fur and hair is going to be less than getting it from a solid surface,\" says Graham, the virologist. Still, she said, she would err on the side of caution and ask people not to pet your dog right now.\nGraham says one way to make sure your dog doesn't get touched by overenthusiastic petters is to avoid letting your dog off leash in a place where it may encounter other people. Rather than going to a dog park, she says, \"it might be a better idea to take your dog out in the yard or somewhere you know that there's not going to be a lot of people.\"\nAnd despite the occasional media report of a dog diagnosed with COVID-19, there is no evidence that pets can contract or spread COVID-19. The CDC says it has not received any reports of pets or animals becoming sick with the disease. The American Veterinary Medical Association concurs: \"Infectious disease experts and multiple international and domestic human and animal health organizations agree there is no evidence at this point to indicate that pets become ill with COVID-19 or that they spread it to other animals, including people.\"\nOne note: If you are already sick with COVID-19, the association recommends limiting contact with animals \"out of an abundance of caution\" until more is known about the virus. If you're not sick with the coronavirus, the group says you can interact with your pet as you normally would — while practicing good hygiene, including washing your hands before and after interacting with your pet.",

    "wrong_answer": "So there is some overlap. But there are key differences, too. I've spoken to a bunch of allergists about this. And here is one very important distinction - fever is a symptom of COVID-19, but it is not a symptom of seasonal allergies. With all of that pollen starting to develop around the country, a lot of people are sneezing and will have a runny nose. These are typical symptoms of seasonal allergies but not necessarily typical of coronavirus. Cough is another very important distinction. Coughing is usually not a main symptom of seasonal allergies, but it is a key symptom of COVID-19, especially a dry cough."

    "question": "I've heard that taking drugs like ibuprofen to ease COVID-19 symptoms could actually worsen the progress of the illness. Is that true?",
    "answer": "The World Health Organization and many infectious disease experts say that there is no good scientific evidence establishing a link between ibuprofen and worsening of COVID‑19.\nThe notion that such a link exists was sparked last weekend when a tweet by the French health minister warned people not to take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs — a category of pain relievers and fever reducers that includes ibuprofen — because, he said, some French COVID-19 patients had experienced serious side effects. The warning was also included in a bulletin from the French health ministry, which counseled that patients should instead use acetaminophen, the generic name for Tylenol.\nBut experts say that warning isn't based on data.\n\"Based on currently available information, WHO does not recommend against the use of ibuprofen,\" the WHO stated on its official Twitter account, adding, \"'We are also consulting with physicians treating COVID-19 patients and are not aware of reports of any negative effects of ibuprofen, beyond the usual known side effects that limit its use in certain populations.\"\nDr. Angela Rogers, a pulmonologist at the Stanford University Medical Center and chair of its intensive care unit's COVID-19 task force, notes that Tylenol is the go-to medication for patients who are sick enough to be hospitalized for any infection. That's because these patients are at higher risk of damage to internal organs, including kidneys. And kidney damage can be a side effect of ibuprofen for some patients who use it long-term in higher doses, says Rogers, whose research focuses on the kind of acute respiratory distress experienced by the most severe COVID-19 cases.\nTylenol, like any medicine, isn't risk-free either; Rogers notes that acetaminophen can cause serious liver damage in high doses. In low doses, though, she says, Tylenol is \"very effective\" for reducing fever and \"very safe.\"",

I mean, 12 to 18 months is an optimistic estimate out there.\n\nIn regard to treatments, there are clinical trials underway to look at the safety, efficacy of different drugs, from antivirals to antibody treatments. With one candidate, an antiviral called Remdesivir, some early results are expected later this spring, and there's a lot of hope out there. But obviously it's important to see what the studies find."

    "answer": "With new research that suggests the new coronavirus can live on surfaces for hours or days, the prospect of going grocery shopping can seem daunting.\nBut you can manage the risk.\nFirst of all, the viability of the virus goes down over time and it's sensitive to temperature – so it dies off more quickly in room temperature than it does in the cold.\nSecond, when you go to a grocery store, people aren't generally touching all the cans on the shelf — although there tends to be more handling of individual items in the produce section.\nAmong the things you can do to protect yourself and others are:\nKo says it helps to understand the differing levels of risk in different situations. Coming into close contact with a person who is infected with coronavirus carries greater risk than touching a shopping cart that might have been touched by an infected person hours or days earlier.\nWhen it comes to disinfecting things, it makes sense to focus on high-touch surfaces. Ko says you should worry more about disinfecting bathroom doorknobs and faucets at home than about a can of tomato soup from the supermarket.\n\"There's never anything that has zero risk,\" Ko says, \"but the risk is so much lower than [surfaces] that are more frequently touched.\"",

    "answer": "The primary benefit of covering your nose and mouth is that you protect others. While there is still much to be learned about the novel coronavirus, it appears that many people who are infected are shedding the virus – through coughs, sneezes and other respiratory droplets – for 48 hours before they start feeling sick. And others who have the virus – up to 25%, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield — may never feel symptoms but may still play a role in transmitting it.\nThat's why wearing a mask even if you don't feel sick can be a good idea.\nIf you cough or sneeze, the mask can catch those respiratory droplets so they don't land on other people or surfaces. \"So it's not going to protect you, but it is going to protect your neighbor,\" says Dr. Daniel Griffin at Columbia University, an expert on infectious diseases. \"If your neighbor is wearing a mask and the same thing happens, they're going to protect you. So masks worn properly have the potential to benefit people.\"\nThe best masks are N95 respirators, but the general public is urged not to use them because they are fiercely needed by health care workers right now.

But here's something to be aware of - younger adults can be vulnerable too; about 20% of people hospitalized were in their 40s and 50s. And this may come as a surprise - about 20% were younger.

And what Anthony Fauci, the top adviser, has said over the weekend is that the social distancing, all the measures we're taking - they will have an effect. But we just can't quantify the effect yet. I mean, how much we may be slowing the spread here is masked by the significant increase in cases each day, as you just mentioned at the top.\n\nSo you know, as testing expands, we're going to get this increase in cases. Hard to see the progress here - it's likely going to be much, much longer before life feels like normal again, right? I mean, many schools have extended closures. There'll be lots of distance learning going on. Many scientists and public health experts watching China as the country lifts its restrictions. Does the virus stay under control, or does it start to spread again? We can learn a lot by watching what happens there."

    "question": "Would a scarf work?",
    "answer": "Probably not as well as a mask that fits closely to your face.\n\"You can imagine if you put a loosely knit scarf with lots of holes in it ... that would not be very effective,\" says Dr. Michael Klompas, an infectious disease physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital.\nThe goal is to create a barrier that catches droplets and keeps others from coming in, so you want coverage that is tightly woven and close-fitting.",
    "wrong_answer": "Yes. But only if you use the mask properly and don't touch it with your hands afterward.\nThose droplets from a cough or sneeze would hit your mask instead of your mouth and nose — good news. But the next step is to take the mask off by the ear bands and either wash or discard it — without touching the front of it.\n\"That's what I see all the time,\" says Griffin. \"That's why in the studies, masks fail — people don't use them [correctly]. They touch the front of it. They adjust it. They push it down somehow to get their nose stuck out.\"\nIf you touch the front of the mask, whatever that person coughed or sneezed on it is now on your hands.\nAs this video from the World Health Organization shows, you should take off your mask by removing the elastics or straps from behind your ears. Don't touch the front, and keep the mask away from your face.\nOne other thing: Ideally you would have eye protection, too, to keep that stranger's sneeze from getting in. Glasses and sunglasses aren't perfect but can help."

There's a public health crisis right now, there's a virus going around, we need to be on top guard,\" says Klompas. \"I think it can actually be a reinforcer, a reminder of the state of crisis that we face in society.\"\nBut he says that masks are not a replacement for all the other steps we need to take right now to protect ourselves from the coronavirus — especially social distancing and good hand hygiene.",

If measures to slow the disease aren’t effective, the virus could sicken millions of people, losing steam on the coasts in May before spreading to the rest of the country over the summer.

But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away."

    "answer": "A coronavirus emergency relief package, passed by Congress in mid-March, gives qualified workers [two weeks of paid sick leave](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/upshot/coronavirus-paid-leave- guide.html) if they are ill, quarantined or seeking a diagnosis or preventive care for the coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus.  Many workers at small and midsize companies and nonprofits can get the paid leave, as can government employees, as long as they’ve been employed at least 30 days. The law includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. But it excludes those at companies with more than 500 people, including many front-line employees at many major retailers and fast-food restaurants.  Workers at places with fewer than 50 employees are included, but the Labor Department could exempt small businesses if providing leave would put them out of business. Employers can also decline to give leave to workers on the front lines of the crisis: health care providers and emergency responders.",

Goodman, an economics correspondent for The Times, says there’s a key difference between that economic turmoil and today’s: the utter unpredictability of the outbreak’s spread. “The disaster feels eerily familiar, with trillions of dollars in wealth annihilated near-daily and deepening fears that businesses will fail,” [he writes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/business/coronavirus-global- economy.html). “Yet the traditional policy prescriptions seem no match for the affliction at hand.”  The very means of controlling the health crisis — keeping workers home, limiting travel and disrupting commerce — risk making the economic crisis worse.  “A sense of powerlessness is feeding the fear that is prompting investors to dump anything risky, which is in turn damaging economic prospects and reinforcing fear — a feedback loop,” he writes."

For [older Americans](https://www.cdc.gov/aging/emergency/pdf/SIP-pan-flu- injects.pdf) and those with health problems who are most at risk if they contract the coronavirus, having goods delivered makes sense.

[European companies](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/12/europes-deliveroo-and-glovo- switch-on-contactless-delivery-during-covid-19-pandemic/) are doing it, too.  Those services have a large network in place, though, which means their businesses are likely to thrive. Smaller retailers will not as Americans eschew restaurants, bars and specialty stores. That is why some restaurants are promoting delivery services as a way to stay in business, and why some cities that have ordered restaurants and bars to close have made exceptions for places providing delivery and takeout.  But what about delivery workers? Some groups, like Gig Workers Rising, are demanding that employers like Doordash and Instacart do more to protect them on the job. Recently, the group started [a petition](https://www.coworker.org/petitions/demand-gig-economy-companies- give-paid-sick-time-off-during-coronavirus) asking companies to provide paid time off to drivers who become sick during the coronavirus outbreak and cannot work.  The bottom line is this: Online deliveries are a boon for those who cannot leave their homes, as well as small restaurants who fear going out of business. But at the same time it comes with a risk to drivers and delivery workers who fear the loss of income if they get sick. At a minimum, everyone should generously tip their drivers for the service."

    "wrong_answer": "The C.D.C. has guidelines about laundry. It says do not shake dirty laundry, to minimize the possibility of dispersing the virus through the air. If possible, wash items using the warmest water setting, and dry thoroughly. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with an ill person can be washed with other people’s items, the C.D.C. said.  Clean and disinfect hampers or other carts for transporting laundry, according to the guidelines for cleaning surfaces.  The need for physical distancing has prompted some laundromats to dismantle their seating areas, according to Planet Laundry, the magazine of the Coin Laundry Association. Some laundromats are asking people to stay in their cars during their wash and dry cycles, and some have removed chairs and tables to discourage people from mingling.  Commercial-grade washers and dryers operate at higher temperatures and with more rigorous mechanical action that, when combined with hot water and proper detergent use, can effectively flush contaminants from clothing better than residential machines, says the association, which represents 30,000 small businesses."

    "question": "I have older neighbors. How can I help them?",
    "answer": "Older people seem to be particularly susceptible to contracting the coronavirus, according to health officials. Some are staying at home and, as a precaution, may not open their doors to visitors.  One way to check on homebound older residents without jeopardizing their health is to call or send a text, [said Eric. S. Goldstein](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-help- volunteer.html), the chief executive officer of the UJA-Federation of New York, which provides food, health care and other services to people in need.  If telephone calls and texts are not an option, “talk through the door,” Mr. Goldstein said. Because some people may recoil at the suggestion that they are not self-sufficient, Mr. Goldstein suggested offering to help in a low-key way, such as saying, “I’m running to the market, can I get you anything?”",
    "wrong_answer": "You shouldn’t. But if Skype, FaceTime or another app is an option, you can make a virtual visit. And there’s always the old-fashioned telephone call, too.  The virus is especially bad for older people like your grandma and grandpa, which means it’s even more important for them to [stay away from](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/parenting/grandparents-visit-safety- coronavirus.html) other people. It can be hard, but this keeps them healthier."

    "question": "What does ‘stay at home’ mean?",
    "answer": "Authorities in different states have used different phrases while asking people to stay home.  Generally, it means you should limit trips outside except for essential needs. You can still go for walks and exercise, but do it in a way that keeps you several feet away from other people. You can still go to the grocery store, but try to go once a week instead of more frequently. And wash your hands when you come back inside.",
    "wrong_answer": "__ Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions —[don’t](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/business/coronavirus-401k-contributions.html)! In fact, if your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.”  Many components of the stimulus package, passed on March 27, include changes to rules regarding retirement account withdrawals, borrowing and penalties."

Be sure to get up and stretch, because [exercise](https://www.nytimes.com/guides/well/how-to-build-muscle) can help burn off pent up energy. Here’s a [quick guide to an at-home workout](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/204-strength-home- workout-1/ac351695049524bfb879/optimized/full.pdf) where the only equipment you need is a resistance band. While you’re moving, spend some time disinfecting surfaces in your home to keep everything clean. The C.D.C. [recommends you clean and disinfect](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html) high-contact surfaces, including tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets and sinks every day.  And check in with your loved ones. Social distancing doesn’t mean disconnecting from those you care about, and older relatives and friends are susceptible to loneliness, which researchers have found [comes with its own set of health hazard](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/health/lonliness- aging-health-effects.html)s. So make sure to FaceTime your parents and grandparents.

    "wrong_answer": "It depends. Schools are closed for different lengths of time, and it's unclear when it will be safe to go back. Some schools are trying learning-from-home programs, and others are offering free lunches for pick-up. Ask your parents."

    "question": "Can I make my home safer?",
    "answer": "So, you’re at home, like millions of other Americans. There are some simple practices there that you can follow to help reduce the risk of being exposed to or spreading the virus. Always remember the basics, like washing your hands frequently (and reminding members of your household to do so) and having two weeks worth of meals and any other essentials.  But don’t forget about cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces daily; that includes the interior of your vehicle, like the steering wheel. And when doing laundry, use the warmest appropriate setting and dry items fully.",

    "question": "Is it ethical to order delivery in a pandemic?",
    "answer": "It’s a complicated question, right? Officials are telling us to stay indoors and away from others. At the same time, you need food or, as importantly, medicine. But what about the health of the delivery workers who come to your door? How do we keep each other safe?  For [older Americans](https://www.cdc.gov/aging/emergency/pdf/SIP-pan-flu- injects.pdf) and those with health problems who are most at risk if they contract the coronavirus, having goods delivered makes sense. Some companies, [like Postmates](https://blog.postmates.com/introducing-non-contact- deliveries-ac2f23462909) and [Instacart](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-instacart-delivers- groceries-without-human-contact-2020-3), have begun offering non-contact or curbside deliveries. [European companies](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/12/europes-deliveroo-and-glovo- switch-on-contactless-delivery-during-covid-19-pandemic/) are doing it, too.  Those services have a large network in place, though, which means their businesses are likely to thrive. Smaller retailers will not as Americans eschew restaurants, bars and specialty stores. That is why some restaurants are promoting delivery services as a way to stay in business, and why some cities that have ordered restaurants and bars to close have made exceptions for places providing delivery and takeout.  But what about delivery workers? Some groups, like Gig Workers Rising, are demanding that employers like Doordash and Instacart do more to protect them on the job. Recently, the group started [a petition](https://www.coworker.org/petitions/demand-gig-economy-companies- give-paid-sick-time-off-during-coronavirus) asking companies to provide paid time off to drivers who become sick during the coronavirus outbreak and cannot work.  The bottom line is this: Online deliveries are a boon for those who cannot leave their homes, as well as small restaurants who fear going out of business. But at the same time it comes with a risk to drivers and delivery workers who fear the loss of income if they get sick. At a minimum, everyone should generously tip their drivers for the service.",
    "wrong_answer": "Yes! Getting exercise outside is a great alternative to going to the gym, where touching high-contact equipment can pose a risk (if your gym is even still open). A [study last year found infectious germs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6339305/) on about a third of the surfaces at 16 different fitness facilities. Exercise boosts our immune systems, and even a single workout can improve our ability to fight off germs, [according to the latest research](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/well/move/exercise-immunity- infection-coronavirus.html). Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea."
